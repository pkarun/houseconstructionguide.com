When we started renting our first property, we had no clue.

Ours is a student rental area. Which means more rent, more maintenance, and fewer headaches.

After renting our property for 3 years, we understood what could have been done better and what could have been avoided.

No one guided us that before.

Even a small small things matter for a better experience.

All the lessons I learned from my experience and observation.

Rental property shouldn't be treated as owner property in all the terms. This property requires maintenance work every time a tenant vacates the property.

Once any tenant vacates the property (which happens often), a lot of cleaning and repainting work will be involved. So it's your job to make sure you make that task easier.

How do you do that?

That's something I share inside my Rental Property Guide.

When building your rental property, always keep one thing in mind.

"How can I make my maintenance job easier?"

If you keep that thing in mind and build your property, it will help a lot in the rest of your rental property journey.
