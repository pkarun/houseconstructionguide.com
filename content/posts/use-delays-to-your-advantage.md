Today, my dad and I went to see the status of our 32 Diwan cots order that we placed a few weeks ago.

The vendor delivery date came near, so we went to see how the work is going…

To our surprise, the vendor has not yet started our order.

Spoke with the owner and told them to deliver fast and come back.

This type of delay is common in almost all areas. You may also encounter similar delays in the delivery of some construction-related items.

I have a small tip or suggestion I recommend you follow to avoid such delays or get benefit from such delays.

The idea is…

Ask the vendor when they can deliver the product. Double confirm the delivery date…

Once they confirm the date, you tell them - if you don't deliver on that date, I will cut ₹XXXX from the payment amount.

The amount you mention shouldn't be too high…. The seller should be able to easily bear the amount, or else he won't allow you to deduct it on the payment day.

With such a condition, you usually get it on or before the delivery date, or you will save money on the order.

I used this strategy during construction, and it worked very well.

I immediately remembered this strategy as soon as I learned that the cot guys had not started working on our cot order.

I thought I could have used it here as well. On the day of the order, I didn't go there.

It's better to follow my house construction tracking system to execute this idea successfully, or it could fail.

This is a system/guide designed to execute many such things without fail.
