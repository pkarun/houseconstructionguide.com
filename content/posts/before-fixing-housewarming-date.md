Tomorrow, my brother's wife's house has a Satyanarayana Swamy pooja in their home. As Per their initial plan, my brother and his wife are supposed to sit for the pooja.

Everything was ok until we asked our astrologer about the date. 

Our Astrologer told us not to sit them for pooja on that day…

He said the date was not good. 

So, we paid their fees to get a good alternative day to do the pooja. The astrologer gave few other days. When they tried to change the date to an alternative good date, all those dates Cook and Astrologers were busy on those days.

Because of the date issues with the cook and astrologers on those good days, they decided to do the pooja on a not-so-good date, which was already fixed earlier. 

Now, my brother's wife's parents are ready to sit for the pooja instead of my brother and his wife.

All these date-changing processes happened a few days before the pooja scheduled date. So on urgent, they couldn’t change the pooja date. Now they are left with no option apart from doing pooja on an ok date.

There is no such big event on the pooja date, so they decided to go with that date itself. What could you have done if the same happened on your housewarming date?

In that case, it will be big trouble. Changing the Housewarming date once all the arrangements are made is not easy… 

So make sure to properly fix the date.

Most astrologers give dates based on their availability, which may not be a good date for you. I noticed this multiple times.

You can see the same thing in the above incident as well. 

If you don’t want to be the victim of such a thing, I shared a tip inside my [Housewarming Function](https://houseconstructionguide.com/housewarming-function/). Keep that in mind when you are construction is almost ready to go over. 

Getting a good date for an important event is really important. Atleast it is for me.
