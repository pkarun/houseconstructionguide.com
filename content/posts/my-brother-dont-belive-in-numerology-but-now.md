My younger brother doesn't usually believe much in numerology stuff. But recently, one small negative event happened in his life.

He spoke about that with his close relative guy in a general talk.

The guy who he spoke recently started studying numerology out of self-interest and sharing his lessons with friends and observing their results.

When my brother spoke to our relative, he explained that his mobile number was not good and how that mobile number was affecting his life.

He did not just explain that. He also shared a few real-life case studies about how they are seeing positive improvements in their lives after taking his numerology suggestions.

He suggested a good mobile number for my brother based on his birth date. (I guess for free of cost, as bro is very close)

My brotherâ€¦ who has a kind of fancy number and never changed his mobile number for the past 8+ years (to my knowledge), took the second sim.

He still has an old sim. However, he actively started using a numerology mobile number for the past few days.

Changing the old sim is not easy, so he is using both numbers for the time being.

Why I'm sharing this?

I'm not sure how much you believe in the concept of numerology. As per my observation, numerology works.

After your house construction is over, you can use numerology concepts while naming your house. As you have nothing loose.

In our second building, I used numerologically compatible names for our house.

The only problem most of them face is that finding such names is very difficult.

That's why I built an Excel sheet to make your job easier.

All you need to do is find a number that is good for the house owner and find a name that matches that good number.

By doing this, you have nothing to lose.
