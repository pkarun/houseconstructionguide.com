While lying on my bed and scrolling through YouTube shorts, I came across an awesome curtain tip everyone must know.

When I returned to my second home, I took my bedroom curtain and implemented the tip... and it worked!!

Immediately, I started writing this email to share this tip... 

I myself needed this tip in my home. 

In our bedroom curtain, always have a gap between the two curtains. When we keep our windows open at night for ventilation, that small gap always gets bigger…

Which is quite annoying.

If any of your windows uses two curtains and you notice a gap between them when you close the curtains, and you want to avoid those gaps, then here is an Awesome tip.

Instead of me writing and sharing how to do that, it's better if you watch the live demo video below:

Ok, but it also comes with one slight disadvantage. Now, you need to keep the curtain on one side only instead of both sides. 

For me, that disadvantage is ok compared to the curtain gap annoyance…

Let me know if this tip helps by replying to this email.
