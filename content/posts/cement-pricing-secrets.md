So you are constructing your dream house and want to order Cement. Then, read this page before you order Cement again.

Why?

Because you may unknowingly be paying ***₹5 to ₹25*** more prices for each cement bag every time you order Cement from your local cement shop.

We (Me & my Dad) learned about this fact later.. at the end of our house construction, and you're lucky because if you read this guide, you will see what we did to save money and how we come to know about this.

I won't guarantee it will work 100% for you as well. Instead, I can show what I did to save money, how we learned about this method, what you can do, and how to do it without holding anything.

**We Wasted '₹29,500' by Buying Cement without Knowing this Secret Method** 

I'm not sure how much extra your local cement shops charge you. But in my case, we were paying an extra **₹25** per cement bag in our local cement shop.

I just calculated we ordered 1,180 cement bags from a local cement trader shop near our construction building. I came to know about that; I could have ordered the same Cement at ₹25 lesser than what our local cement shop was charging from this secret method official source.

So let's calculate how much we have paid extra/wasted our hard-earned Money by buying Cement without knowing this hidden cement buying tip.

1,180 = No of cement bags we already bought from our local cement shop

₹25 = is the margin local cement shop is keeping per Cement bag

**1180 \* 25 = ₹29,500**

So we wasted/paid an extra ₹29,500 by buying without knowing this secret Cement buying method.

**No Need to Compare Cement Price Again with Other Shops** 

We are always skeptical if the cement shop we are ordering is charging the correct price or charging more.

It always be there in our minds.

We sometimes even try to verify cement prices by calling all nearby cement shops or manually visiting every shop.

If you follow the guide that I'm going to show here in this guide, you don't need to worry about thinking about such stuff. Because you always get the Least Selling Price! (Atleast it did for us)

If you think this Secret method will work for your favorite cement brand or not, then I'm going to say it works for all types of cement brands. The only requirement is that the cement brand you plan to buy should be distributed in nearby local cement shops.
