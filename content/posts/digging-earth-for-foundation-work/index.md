You must dig the earth surrounding your site boundary to build [size stone](https://houseconstructionguide.com/size-stone-price/) masonry work. This work is usually done by manual labourers, not with JCB.

If you try to do it with the JCB, the proper size won't come, and the chances of pillars/footing damage will be there.
