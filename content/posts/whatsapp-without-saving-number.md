A few days back, I shared the below tip on my Tech blog at [Ashout.com](https://ashout.com/). I believe the tip below is helpful for you, so I'm also sharing it here.

If you bought my [House construction tracking system](https://houseconstructionguide.com/house-construction-tracking-system/), I showed you how to use WhatsApp in your House construction process. You can use the tip below to communicate with users without saving their contact numbers. 

\-------------------

Today I felt bored, so I started asking some questions to ChatGPT (a popular AI website). 

One question I asked was… "_can you send WhatsApp messages without saving a number?_"

**ChatGPT answer**: 

"No, it is not possible to send a WhatsApp message without saving the recipient's number first. In order to send a message to someone on WhatsApp, you must have their phone number saved in your contacts. This is a security feature of WhatsApp and it ensures that only people you know and have saved in your contacts can message you on the app."

### Nope... 

### not right!

Even I thought the same. 

Recently I came to know it's not TRUE.

You can send WhatsApp messages without saving any number on your phone contact list. And you don't even need any additional apps to do this. 

Steps to Send WhatsApp message 
-------------------------------

without Saving Number 
----------------------

**Step 1**: Click on the "**Chat**" icon on the bottom right of the WhatsApp UI

**Step 2**: You will be in the "**Select Contact**" option. On the top right, you will see the "**Search**" icon. Click on that icon.

**Step 3**: Now enter a new number not saved on your Phone contacts. You need to enter only 10 digits number… don't enter any country code like **_+91_**. 

If the user is available on WhatsApp, you will see the "**Chat**" option. If the user is unavailable, you won't find that option.

It looks like ChatGPT gives _OUTDATED_ answers sometimes.  

Did you know this trick before?
