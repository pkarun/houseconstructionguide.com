When ordering main doors, everyone just thinks about the wood they use in the door and the design of the door.

This is how first-time users always think…

Nothing wrong with that.

But I have something to share if you are a beginner in construction. Because, in most cases, you won’t be aware of what I will share.

This is one of the important points I recommend every user keep in mind while buying readymade wooden doors, ordering custom-made wooden doors in shops, or giving wood to your carpenter to make your door.

This is related to the **Main Door Design** or the main doors... It’s not just about door design. It’s more than that.

Ignore this guide; *you may need to be doing door maintenance work every few years once.*

I added this Main Door Design guide inside the member's area a few days back. If you have an All-Access Pass, log in to your member's area to find this guide.

I recommend you go through this guide once before you think about the main doors in your building.

You won’t find this type of guide online. 

This guide is written from my personal experience with relevant photos to help you easily understand the concept of main door design.
