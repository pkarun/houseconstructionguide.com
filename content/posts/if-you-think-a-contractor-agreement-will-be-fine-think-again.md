All experienced contractors know where the difference between owners and contractors comes from. Because they have already built at least a few houses.

When you ask them to bring a building contract agreement, they bring the agreement, which is important to safeguard their interest. Not the owner's interest.

Most new users planning to start construction don't know about those insider construction points that must be included in the agreement.

So, to make their job easier, they go with the whatever the contractor bought agreement and deal done.

We also did the same thing. But while picking contractor, we filtered a lot. It helped! So everthing went well in our case. 

Now… if everything goes well between you and the contractor, the agreement doesn't matter.

If… you and your contractors have any differences, the contractors start ignoring your project, and you get angry.

Not just that…

Sometimes, even disputes arise depending on the contractor's nature.

If you have a solid agreement mentioning the most important points in the agreement regarding work scope, payment terms, responsibility, etc.,

You have something to speak to your contractor regarding work scope and all… your contractor will listen in that case. Because it's in writing. There is nothing to hide.

Suppose this is the first time you are trying to start house construction. In that case, I recommend at least discussing with a few of your friends who have gone through house construction experience recently so they can share their thoughts with you.

Before signing any agreements, show them to your friends and ask their opinion… if they give some suggestions, you can request the same from your contractor to make changes.

By doing this type of exercise, you will avoid making a few mistakes.

Whatever the option you choose, don't take a decision in a hurry or alone.

Happy Weekend.
