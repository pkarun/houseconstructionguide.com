Before we built our house, we stayed in a few rental properties. 

One rental property taught me a very good lesson I need to remember while building our house.

After experiencing that painful lesson from the rental property mistake they made with their parking, I remember that point very well, and I don't want to make that mistake in our house.

If I hadn't felt the painful lesson there, I wouldn't have had the idea to avoid that mistake.

And I believe our contractors and engineers also don't bother guiding such tip….

It's a very important lesson everyone needs to remember when building their house.

Unfortunately, most first-time builders don't remember such small tips they need to remember, which could affect your lifestyle later. In most cases, engineers, building contractors and labourers also don't bother guiding us.

Wherever I go, I see old and new buildings. Almost 60% of the houses make this mistake. I think most of them make this mistake only because they do not know this tip and the consequences of the problem they face later.

Hence, I'm handing over this most important and very simple tip every house builder needs to be aware of….

Ignore this simple mistake, and you'll suffer every time you take or park your vehicle in your parking area.

Initially, I wanted to charge a premium price for this tip, but I changed my plan later.

The more serious you take this, the more convenient you get in parking.
