After fixing one of the tenant's fan issues recently, I decided to share the incident below. 

At the end of our house construction, we went to buy a ceiling fan for our rental property.

We shop for all our construction-related products in the hardware shop we went to. Me and my dad simply asked the shop owner which brand fan we would buy like…

He suggested some well-known brands, and I checked online to see that the product got a 40K+ rating on Flipkart, so I ordered around 26 fans of that brand.

This is one of the worst decisions I made when picking the product. The reason is that the fans are not of good quality, and we realised this mistake only after 6 months of using these fans.

How?

We started getting complaints from our tenants. 

At first, we thought it was our tenant's issue, but later, we realised it was a fan problem.

All our rental properties using this brand fan have one or the other complaint.

All the complaints have happened less than 1.6 years after buying this fan.

I’m tired of booking complaints and dealing with this company's ceiling fans. 

I discussed the issue with our seller, and he said this is the first complaint I’m receiving. None of the other customers are having any such complaints.

I believe within 1.6 years, we have received more than 6 fan complaints from this bad company.

Complaints like -

1) Fan making too much sound

2) Fan blades got bent due to poor quality blade

3) Fan Bearing gone

4) The fan rod got broken!

5) The fan stopped working

6) Fan shaking too much due to bolt thread issue… etc., many such complaints. 

Meanwhile, in our first building, we used some different company fans. We had around 10 fans from one good company. I guess it is almost 6 years, and we might have received 1 or 2 minor complaints. That, too, is not related to fan quality issues. 

I regret buying/trying this bad brand fan instead of buying proven and tested fans from a good brand company.

Next time, before you buy any appliance, don’t just listen to the store owner's suggestion. He might be suggesting a new brand for commission purposes. Use your own experience as well. 

If you want to know from my experience, I suggest getting an [All-Access Pass](https://houseconstructionguide.com/products/#all-access-pass), where I can share all of my learning.

If you are an All-Access Pass holder, check out the [Electrical Work Guide](https://houseconstructionguide.com/electrical-work-guide/) in the 5.72 & 5.73 section to see my Bad and Good Fan company recommendation. 

We already planned to replace all 26 fans from bad company when any issues arise.

We are already tired of wasting our time listening and fixing fan problems from bad company.
