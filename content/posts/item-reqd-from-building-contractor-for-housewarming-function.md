We recently finished our housewarming function.

I remembered one point I need to mention in the Building contractor guide.

You need these items from your building contractor till the housewarming function is over.

Sometimes, your contractor takes these items as soon as the work is over if you don't ask them to keep them.

Other times, they will inform you they will bring back when you need them and take back their items.

There is nothing wrong with giving their items back. But the problem is when you need that item, who will bring it back? Do you think the contractor will bring it back?

No.

Even if a contractor is ready to bring that item, you must spend money on transportation.

If you don't want to spend money or take extra risks, then you need to remember one point.

[That point has been added to the Building contractor guide at 4.60.](https://houseconstructionguide.com/building-contractor-guide/)

Remember that point at the ending stage of your building.
