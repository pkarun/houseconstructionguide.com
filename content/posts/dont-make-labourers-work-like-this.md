Right, in front of my home office window, one construction work is going on…

Today, they are doing pillar concrete work.

It looks like the owner or contractor asked labourers to do overnight work to finish all the concrete work on the pillars. 

The problem is, at 7.50PM, they are still doing concrete work. 

Now, a power failure has also happened here in my place. 

So they don't have any alternative light arrangement or power to use a concrete vibrator to properly set concrete inside the pillar box.

They are just using their mobile battery to do the work…. 

How could anyone expect quality work in such an environment?

By this time, labourers are also tired. The work quality always decreases as work time increases.

Avoid giving such overtime work schedules to labourers. 

It's simply a loss for owners. 

In very extreme cases, you should opt for overtime duty. Not always…

OT work is always a loss for owners and a profit for labourers. So, use OT only when required.
