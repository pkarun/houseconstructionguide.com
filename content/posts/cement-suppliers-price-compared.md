Yesterday… I had to order cement. I just needed to order only **10 bags**. Because our building is already in the finishing stage, the method I explained in cement pricing secrets won't work in low quantity orders.

So I had no option but to look for a nearby cement seller.

It was afternoon… I took my bike to check pricing with all the local sellers. Here's their response.

### Visiting cement shops…

**Shop 1**: This is the cement shop nearest our building. We already lost more than **₹29,500** without knowing the method explained in my book, so I skipped without asking for the cement price.

**Shop 2**: I asked what's the price of Zuvari 43 grade cement… seller responded "**₹420**" per bag

I know ₹420 is quite more as I used to buy Zuvari cement for almost 2 years… so I asked if it is possible to reduce the price a little bit?

He said, "No, sir."

Ok.. now I moved to another shop.

**Shop 3**: Sir, what's the price of Zuvari cement? I need 10 bags. He repsonded "**₹430**…" I told them it's pretty costly.

Sir, can you give to ₹410?

The shop owner said… "NO. "

Me.. moved to another and final shop which is near to our building.

**Shop 4**: Sir, what's the price of Zuvari? He told… No stock. I'm not ordering because Zuvari's primary seller sells at **₹440** per bag, so I'm not ordering.

Me.. hmm.

I didn't speak anything here. As there is no use discussing so moved on and ordered at Shop 2.

### I called my Secret Cement Supplier

Out of curiosity, I called my secret cement supplier as explained in the Cement Pricing Secrets ebook, and asked about the price of Zuvari cement.. he responded, "**₹395**".

Ok…I told him,"I called to know the price and cut the call".

### The price difference with my Secret cement supplier

**Shop 1**: I didn't ask

**Shop 2**: +20rs

**Shop 3**: +30rs

**Shop 4**: He didn't quote the price but told me the main seller only sells at +40rs. He also needs to add his profit margin. So you can guess how much the difference could be yourself.

This is why I shared my method of finding secret cement suppliers in my cement pricing secrets ebook.

If you still haven't bought, you might be losing money on every cement bag you order.
