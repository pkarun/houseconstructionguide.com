The last rice bag also getting over…

We needed to order a few rice bags. Because the older the rice, the better it is.

We usually buy a few rations from a nearby provision store rest of them my brother order online.

Every time I order a rice bag, I always pay first so when he delivers to our house, I don't need to go to pay him.

I used to follow this method many times…

Whenever I pay him the full amount upfront, he used to deliver after 1 week. That too after multiple followups only he used to deliver…

I don't have any trust issues with the shop.

But we used to waste our time following up with the shop owner to get the product we paid for.

This time, I decided to do something else.

I ordered 3 bags of rice and didn't pay anything in advance.

To my surprise, this time, he delivered the rice bag the next day itself.

This is the first time he has delivered so fast.

Same way…

When you pay the amount in advance, be aware that sometimes, paying in advance can actually slow the product delivery.

I got stuck similarly when we ordered tiles.

I already paid 50% of the amount upfront. The seller is not ready to deliver the product.

He always told me some reasons and kept postponing the delivery date.

I used to follow up with the shop guy almost 30 to 40 times just to get the products that we paid for.

I decided I would never go back to that guy again.

More such tips from real construction experience are shared in my guides.
