It's April. Tax-paying time for property owners.

I informed my brother to see if our municipal office is collecting tax. As this time, no announcement is being made publicly.

My brother took a Notice board photo and sent it to me on WhatsApp. And informed me that due to the election, the office does not collect taxes.

When I checked, I noticed it almost worded like that itself…

I asked the local waterman when he came to collect his regular bribe. He said they were collecting.

So again, I guided him to go inside the office and check again…

The next day, he went inside and noticed they were still collecting taxes.

This time, they didn't publicly announce it due to election duty. Staff may not be there, so…

Due to this, there was no Rush in the office.

So we both didn't wait any longer in the office.

Immediately, we were sent to one officer chamber who billed and collected our property tax and gave all soft copies in WhatsApp as well…

This is my first time seeing an honest and good working officer there.

Which officer will bother to send a soft copy of all the transactions in WhatsApp and one set of Xerox copies as well??

That too in the Gov't office. This time, we got such a good officer.

Last time, the guy doing the same task told us online payment was not working, so go and pay in the bank and give us a challan. They did like that because, in online payment, they need to write transaction ID, so they do whichever is easier for them.

Anyway, this time, we paid Property tax and water bills. Paying on time will get some reward in the bill…

So if you have yet to pay, make the payment on time by visiting the relevant department.

P S: Our Loan broker needs to prepare some loan documents in our first building. While doing that, he skilfully misdirected us and cheated some money. We realized this when we went to the municipal office to pay our Taxes. I shared that story inside my Revenue Site Loan by Brokers.
