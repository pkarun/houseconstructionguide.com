When you start your MS fabrication work on your building, do all kinds of small tasks you may need. 

Example: Valve operating handle, which you need for your sump to ON/OFF the valve.

They usually do this type of small task when they are doing bulk work without any additional price. But if you went fabricator shop separately to get that valve operating handle, they will charge separately.

You can even include them when giving the MS fabrication contract. 

I did this when the MS fabricator came to do a Pipe runner work on my building. While discussing this, I told them I needed one valve operating handle, and they said OK without any additional PRICE.
