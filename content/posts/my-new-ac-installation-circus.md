I recently bought an AC online for my home office. I guess it's already 6 days over…

Still, installation has not yet been done.

After raising a support ticket yesterday, some technicians came but didn't bring the AC vacuum pump.

I noticed and asked them.

They said, "we hadn't bought it".

I informed them not to install the AC without doing the AC vacuuming process.

They left immediately saying other will come and do. 

Ac vacuuming is an important process that needs to be done for all ACs, even for the brand-new ACs. But most of the technicians don’t do this step.

Suppose we install the AC without doing the Vacuuming process. In that case, AC performance will decrease, and affects AC devices in the long run.

The company manual clearly mentions that proper vacuuming must be done before use. Still, technicians don't follow the process.

Many users don't know the process, so technicians don't bother doing this step.

I have already raised multiple complaints with the company and now company shared their local technician's contact number. When I spoke to them, he told me this is not required for new ACs…

What can I do now?

After understanding this technician could not do the AC vacuuming process, I decided to hire private AC technicians to do the installation process.

I contacted a few technicians here… most of them are not ready to do this step. If they want to do this, it takes 30 to 40 minutes extra time.

Moreover, now, in summer, all AC technicians are busy. Every technician has 2 days of work in queue… so we need to wait if we need to book them and get the AC installation done.

After speaking to some private parties, I got an AC technician who understood the proper installation method. But his charges are 800 rs higher than the other technician's quote.

That price is after the bargain.

I don't mind paying little extra fees for the right guy… As it helps in AC performance.

I booked him for this installation instead of the company technician. I will see how it goes on installation day.

If we don't know what we are doing, many are ready to fool us.
