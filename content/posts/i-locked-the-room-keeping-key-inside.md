A few months back, I went to our relative marriage. For staying, they gave us 3 room Keys.

The management installed a Europa cylindrical lock for the main door.

While in a hurry, I turned the lock knob inside the room and pulled the door without verifying the door key.

For this cylindrical lock, you don't need a key to Lock.

Before pulling out the door, I checked my pocket. I had one Key with me. I thought the key was this room key itself and locked the door.

After some time, I came back and noticed the door was not opening with my key.

It's the other room key.

I mistook this key for my room key, and now I locked the door by keeping my room key inside the room.

Now, I need to look for the management guy to ask for the duplicate key to open the door.

Fortunately, after waiting some time, I got the guy in charge.

I informed him I kept the room key inside, and now the door is locked. I need a duplicate key to open the door.

He asked, "What's the room no?"

I informed my room no‚Ä¶

His face immediately turned dull as soon as he listened to room no.

I asked why? What happens?

He replied, "Someone lost that room key a few days back. Now, we don't have a duplicate key for that room."

I also felt a little upset. I thought maybe I needed to call a locksmith to open the lock.

He replied no need. I will open it.

How? I asked.

He said, "With a screwdriver."

Hmm‚Ä¶ come, let's try then.

He came. Within 3 min, he opened the lock with only a screwdriver without damaging the door or lock.

I was surprised watching this scene.

I informed him to get a duplicate key from Europa. He was also shocked to hear that he could get an original duplicate key from the company.

I explained the application process, and he thanked me for sharing this information.

I also thanked him for opening the room key.

When I came back to Bangalore, I searched YouTube about cylindrical locks. Multiple people showed different ways to unlock them very easily.

So‚Ä¶ I want to remind you that if you plan to install a cylindrical lock for the backside door or any outside door, keep in mind that -- it is dead easy to open the lock without key.

Avoid installing Locks that don't require a key to lock. You may accidentally get locked out. Which is not something anyone wishes to be in the situation.

In fact, in the lock box itself, they say don't install outside door kind of warning.

If you install it, use it only for convenience. Not for security purposes.
