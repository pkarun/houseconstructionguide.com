Today, RCC molding work is scheduled in a nearby construction building.

The owner properly arranged all the molding required materials a few days back.

That's a good practice.

But…

He made a mistake. That mistake cost him ₹2K to 3K.

What was that mistake?

The owner assumed where materials needed to be, and he dumped msand and jelly in the previous spot where he used to keep them.

It was the same spot where the previous few molding items were kept. So, the owner assumed he dumped all the materials in the same spot.

The Gang team (labourers who do concrete work) came this morning. They noticed they could not set up their ladder and asked different places to have msand and jelly.

What does the owner need to do now?

So the owner called JCB, and with the help of JCB, they shifted Msand and Jelly to the place they suggested by the Gang team.

It's simply a time and money waste for the owner.

I recommend always asking Gang team members, not even your building contractor, to know where they need molding materials before starting RCC molding work.

They will suggest where they can install the machine, where they need msand, where they need jelly properly.

After that only keep materials as they suggest to avoid extra time and money wastage.

I have an important thing I need to share regarding molding if ground floor molding is not yet done. I shared that tip in my During Moding Time guide.

I highly recommend that you strictly follow what I shared in the guide.
