Today, the 3rd trip cot delivery came, and only 2 guys came from the cot team to deliver. We gave our rope to pull the cots to the 3rd floor as soon as they came.

While pulling the cots, one accident happened.

Our rope broke, and the cot fell from the first floor to the ground floor. Luckily, it didn't fall on any users on the ground floor. It just fell on the ground. It broke a little bit.

After shifting all other cots, I requested the delivery guys take the broken cot to fix the issue. They informed us to please speak to the owner.

We tried reaching the owner but couldn't get in touch with any of them.

I angrily spoke to the delivery guys, saying it's your responsibility to deliver cots to each room. This is what we spoke about while ordering cots. You can ask your owner.

Just to make your job easier, we helped you guys shift. For helping, now we are facing the issue. 

Delivery guys even started blaming us at one point, saying you gave a broken rope. What if it fell on us?

After listening to those words, I felt a little bad. They are now blaming us for helping them.

Today, they were supposed to bring another trip. I clearly told them we wouldn't be helping anymore, so bring more people if required. 

To that, he replied, that's our job. We will do it. Don't worry, he replied. 

After waiting 20 minutes, the delivery guys left the spot as we couldn't get in touch with the owner, leaving the broken cot.

After some time, they bought another trip to deliver. This time, only two persons shifted cots to different floors.

Now I understood; I simply tried to help them and got stuck in a problem. 

Anyhow, owner took the item back to fix it.

Did you see what happened in the above incident?

Even though we tried helping the delivery guys, when the problem happened, the delivery guys blamed us. When everything was good, we didn't have any issues. When something goes wrong, that's when you learn the lesson.

Today, I learned some lessons. Unnecessarily helping can also lead to trouble.

That's why I recommend you have a proper written agreement when you start house construction.

You don't need agreements when all are good. If something goes wrong, that's when you need agreement help.

Make sure all your agreements contain accident-related terms. In all my agreements, it's there. It's one of the important terms and conditions you need to mention.

Suppose you need the labour contract agreement I prepared, which contains almost all such important terms and conditions. In that case, [visit here to get it](/products/#all-access-pass).
