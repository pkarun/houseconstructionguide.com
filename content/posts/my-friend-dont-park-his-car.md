We reached around 2 am Bangalore from the Rameshwarm trip. That time, we took our friend's vehicle, and he also came with us.

He knows how to drive his car. He is not an expert, but he drives his car.

But the funny thing is my friend doesn't park his SUV inside his house parking space. ðŸ™‚

He needs an expert driver to parkâ€¦

He took a test with my brother before he gave us his car for our trip. He said, "If you can park and take a vehicle from my parking space, you will be a good driverâ€¦"

My brother successfully took and parked his SUV, so he was confident enough to give and come with us for the trip.

Forget about the tripâ€¦ This email is all about the parking space in my friend's building.

The same mistake that I shared in my guide "Parking Horror".

To park his vehicle safely in his parking, my brother and I went to his home at 2 am, which is around 1 or 2 km from my home.

We parked his car and took our bikes to return to our house. 

In fact, if my friend asks me to park his SUV inside his parking space, I won't accept his challengeâ€¦ 

I'm not a confident car driver as my brother. 

Whatever I shared in my Parking Horror guide, he made a similar mistake in his building. At one point in time, he informed me that he would do something to fix this issueâ€¦

I replied that you could not do anything now. Time is already over. Instead of fixing it is better to sell the building and buy a new one. Because now it's not really worth fixing such an issue.

Everyone who made this mistake is going to suffer for sureâ€¦ especially if they own any 4-wheelers.

Not just that...

At 2 am, while my brother was parking his SUV, I noticed one more issue that I never shared or observed in my guide, which is now I added a Video demo.

I added the ***updated content with video footage in the 5.7 section in my Parking Horror guide.***

You only notice these problems once house construction is done and when you start using the property. 

Most of these mistakes are not alerted by your building contractors or engineers. 

I recommend learning all such issues before construction time. If you want to fix such issues after construction work is over, it costs a lot of moneyâ€¦ sometimes you cannot even fix some issues.

That's why I'm sharing what I have learned. 

Some of you may not see the value in the silly tips that I shared in my guide. But if you ask someone who made those mistakes, they know the value of such ideas before construction time.
