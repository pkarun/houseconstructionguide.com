When your engineer gives your building plan, they give it on paper containing dimensions, which usually cannot be felt in most cases.

If you want to experience room dimensions live practically, what I recommend is…

Ask labourers to build one course of masonry (one bricklayer) according to the engineer's plan during construction time. Now, go and walk and feel physically to experience the room's size live.

If you find something you need to change, make changes and experience first. If you feel good, then proceed with the remaining construction/masonry work.

Don't make changes too much after construction work is already done.

It's simply a waste of materials and labour charges.

Keep in mind you cannot make changes however you need. You can only change in some areas, not all the places.

The reason is that the engineer plans pillars and beams where required. You cannot move walls randomly…

If you are in doubt, you can always ask the building contractor or engineer before making changes. They will tell if it can be done without issue or not.

When we checked the room size like this, we made our hall a little bigger than the engineer's plan without affecting any load issues.

Not only that…

We made some minor alterations here and there without affecting the engineering plan too much.

If you need to get such ideas, you must do this one brick construction and experience and think in that spot.

The more family members, contractors, friends present on that day, better the idea you can get. 

There is no better suggestion than this tip to experience room sizes.

Most important, valuable, and common mistakes realted to construction are shared in my building contractor guide.

These mistakes are like make once, and suffer longer time kind of…
