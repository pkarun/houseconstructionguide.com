After having a good tea sitting under a [2-speed Atomberg BLDC fan](https://www.amazon.in/s?k=atomberg+bldc+ceiling+fan&crid=1PYGBNCZ0CVC1&sprefix=atomberg+bldc+ceiling+fan%2Caps%2C189&linkCode=ll2&tag=newsite0003-21&linkId=0396211b24b4ba59b9198658475a5c63&language=en_IN&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) in my Home office, I'm writing today's email.

Today, email about saving money on your online shopping.

Who doesn't want to save money on online shopping? everyone doesâ€¦

If you also do, then don't buy anything online now. Wait a few more days.

Amazon India and Flipkart will start the year's greatest sales next month. You can expect a good discount if you shop on those shopping days.

My younger brother and I waited almost a year to shop on those days to get better deals on some bigger and non-urgent items.

Sellers offer discounts

Bank offers discounts

Shopping sites also offer discounts

Combining all or a few of those allows you to save money by shopping online.

Make a list of items you plan to buy online and keep it somewhere. Once sales start, I will send an email so you can grab all those required items at an amazing deal.

If you are not an online shopper, I still recommend try buying at least small items to experience online shopping.

From small items to big home appliances, we order online and save.

Here are some of the [product categories I recommend buying online instead of offline shops to save more](https://houseconstructionguide.com/products-i-recommend-buying-online/) if you are constructing a new home:
