After having a good tea sitting under a 2-speed Atomberg BLDC fan in my Home office, I'm writing today's email.

Today, email about saving money on your online shopping.

Who doesn't want to save money on online shopping? everyone doesâ€¦

If you also do, then don't buy anything online now. Wait a few more days.

Amazon India and Flipkart will start the year's greatest sales next month. You can expect a good discount if you shop on those shopping days.

My younger brother and I waited almost a year to shop on those days to get better deals on some bigger and non-urgent items.

Sellers offer discounts

Bank offers discounts

Shopping sites also offer discounts

Combining all or a few of those allows you to save money by shopping online.

Make a list of items you plan to buy online and keep it somewhere. Once sales start, I will send an email so you can grab all those required items at an amazing deal.

If you are not an online shopper, I still recommend try buying at least small items to experience online shopping.

From small items to big home appliances, we order online and save.

Here are some of the product categories I recommend buying online instead of offline shops to save more if you are constructing a new home:
