On the 14th of this month, we hired our electrician to fix one issue we had been adjusting for several months.

After managing it for a few months, we decided not to adjust and fix that problem. 

We hired the same electrician who did our building's electrical work, so he understands much better about wiring and all…

Moreover, he is an awesome electrician who knows and does only quality work. He never compromises on quality work, no matter who informs him…  

He was such a good worker.

The alteration changes took him hardly 1 hour, but the charges of doing this piece work are always more…

When I asked about his charges for doing it, he didn't ask anything… 

I tried asking 3 times. His reply was always give whatever you want. He didn't demand any amount.

So I was thinking about paying him 500rs. My dad told me to pay ₹1,000. So I paid him ₹1,000. 

When asked later why you asked me to pay that much, he replied -- if you pay less now, they won't come another time when you call for any work. 

Ya... true. 

If we had hired any outside person definitely, they could have charged ₹1,000 or more for doing the same task… 

If you have an adjustment mentality, then you could avoid fixing this kind of comfort issue by rehiring again.  

I prefer that having good comfort is worth paying one-time fees. Even if it takes time, money, and energy to fix it. 

No matter how much experience we have, we still miss some features here and there. We will only be aware of our mistakes when we face such a problem in realtime.
