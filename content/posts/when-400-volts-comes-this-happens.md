At around 5:30 PM, a few tenants started complaining their charges burnt out when they put for charging.

When my dad checked in the meter box, he noticed 400 to 500 volts coming. We immediately switched off the Main incoming power supply to prevent further damage.

Within a few minutes of testing, my DAD informed me it was a Neautral Fault issue. So I called our electrician to come immediately at night time. When we checked in the electrical pole, we noticed our neutral wire was cut.

That wire is not ours. It’s an incoming wire from the main line to our box. Due to heat, that cable got burnt. 

For now, we use the same cable. We need to change that cable to a better and thicker cable for neutral cable, or we may face such an issue again. 

This is a common issue which happens.

Our opposite house once faced this issue and lost their TV. 

If you don’t act immediately, many other electrical devices could also lost. 

I guess around 15,000rs worth of our tenant's devices gone on that day. 

Luckily, we have a setup to turn off the main supply line with one device in our meter box. This is something I recommend everyone to install in your house.

If such issues happen, you can easily disconnect the main supply to prevent further damage.

I shared a more detailed guide on this setup in the 5.16 section of my Electrical Work Guide.
