When we were building our second house, we came across this incident. I never even thought such an accident would happen during our ground-floor molding. 

Because those molding accidents are rare. Very rare.

Usually, while doing RCC centering work, the centering team will be very careful. They know it will also be a big burden for the owners and them if something goes wrong. So they take care very much for RCC centering work. 

But in our case, we encountered big trouble during our molding time due to some careless centering guy.

In this mini-report, I will share our story of why this BIG mistake happened, what went wrong in our case, and how you could take care from happening such an issue during your molding time. 

This is a short report. 

It contains only two sections:

*   Our Story (what happened, how we fixed it)
*   Things you need to Keep in Mind (based on my experience)

If in case we didn't notice the problem and didn't act upon it immediately, I don't know what could have happened to our full mold that day.

If I remember now also, I get scared. Really…

During molding time, if something goes wrong with centering stuff, it could quickly 

become a disaster. 

Buy this mini guide only if you haven't done ground floor molding yet.  

I don't recommend relying on other people's knowledge when spending your money. Some careless guy is enough to create big trouble. 

If you know something, you can easily identify such issues and ask your centering laborer to fix any issues. 

This is one such short report to identify such centering mistakes to prevent molding time issues.
