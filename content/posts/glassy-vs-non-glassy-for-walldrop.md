When it's time to choose wardrobe laminate design, our supplier bought a big laminate design book to choose from.

At first, we chose a Glassy finish design. Before finalizing, I always ask the supplier's opinion once… 

Supplier told, sir… Glassy is usually a little over for wardrobe. I personally don't recommend a glassy finish like he informed me.

Moreover, he also told one more thing.

That is, both glassy and non-glassy laminate sheets cost the same. If you want a glassy laminate sheet, I can do that only as the supplier said.

Today, I made the right decision by listening to that supplier.

Because even if I can imagine a glass look in my wardrobe, I don't feel good.

I don't want to see our faces or our reflection every time I walk in front of it. Just imagine yourself once... 

Some still go with the glass look...  

Maybe they could have changed their opinion if they had thought a little longer about the reflection issue. 

Personally, I feel glassy looks is quite over look. 

Think about it when your time comes to choose a wardrobe laminate sheet. 

One more important wall-drop concept everyone should implement during construction is shared in my [Walldrop guide.](https://houseconstructionguide.com/products/#Walldrop)

I made that mistake in our first building and corrected it in our second building.

Personally I feel it's an important point to keep in mind.
