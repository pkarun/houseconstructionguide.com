When we started our first building, we had little clue about framing contract structures with our building contractor.

Fortunately, we got a good building contractor and didn't face any issues with him apart from paying a little more than the contract condition.

This is due to our mistake. 

We were unaware of a few things we needed to know before starting our house construction.

Anyway. After building two houses, we learned a few things about the building contractor and his work scope.

Everything I learned I'm going to share in this guide.

This will be helpful for all the users planning to start their house construction work soon.

This guide is specially designed to help someone who hasn't finalised their building contractor to their building.

I also shared some tips about your building construction work in this guide.
