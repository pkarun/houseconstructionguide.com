Today, I was handling one of our rental property repainting tasks.

Feeling a little tired going and coming from the 3rd floor to the 1st floor. Luckily, I got a good painter who handled all the tasks from cleaning to painting.

All we need to do is show the work, bring the painting materials and remember if he missing some task. Thats all.

He handles the rest of the work.

Anytime repainting work comes, I check if any small pending work is left during construction time and execute such work now.

When you're doing construction, it's really difficult to notice small things. Because you're quite busy with a lot of work already…

You should also be thinking about finishing as soon as possible. So, any small stuff goes unnoticed.

That's why when repair tasks come in rental property, I check small things I couldn't give attention to during construction and ask my painter to fix such issues.

When verifying such small attention to detail, I noticed Our Painting Contractors didn't paint any outside window grill.

Which we cannot easily identify…

I need to put my mobile or any mirror outside the window to see if the outside window grill painting is done.

I didn't notice that at construction time. Now I see that.

It's difficult to paint the outside grill without a painter's rope. But still, I asked my painter to do that painting from inside the house as much as possible.

No matter what, some mistakes always happen.

Another issue I'm actively watching in all my rental property is shared inside [my Electrical Work Guide at 5.63.](https://houseconstructionguide.com/electrical-work-guide/)

I also got that issue in this unit as well. Once my brother comes, we will go and fix that issue.

It's an important thing many electricians don't care… but you have to.

I have a few things to share about rental property construction. I will [write a guide](https://houseconstructionguide.com/products/#27-rental-property-construction-guide) (paid) once I'm in the mood.
