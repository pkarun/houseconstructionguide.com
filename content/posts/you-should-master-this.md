While building your house, one thing you should master isâ€¦ saying "NO" to your contractor.

What I'm referring to isâ€¦

Contractors usually call suddenly out of nowhere and tell some story to ask for moneyâ€¦

That's a common practice done by all contractors in most cases.

Once you say YESâ€¦ they may return it or ask you to deduct it from future payments.

And within a few days, they will have some other issues.

Again they will call you and ask for moneyâ€¦

The cycle keeps on continuingâ€¦ and the return cycle **won't**.

Now at some point in time, you realize you have already paid way more money than you are supposed to pay to your contractor.

**YOU who helped initially are the ones who get stuckâ€¦**

You cannot deduct from labor payment... because the contractor will stop sending laborers if you do so.

You cannot ask your contractor to pay you backâ€¦ because you will feel SHY asking him like that ðŸ™‚

### **So the better way to deal?**

Say "NO" when they ask for extra for the first time.

â€¦

They will ask againâ€¦ Again say "NO" next time alsoâ€¦

If they ask againâ€¦ the same. Say NO.

â€¦

â€¦

I guess they don't continue from now onwards.

By this time, they understood you wouldn't pay extra, so they never bother asking for some made-up emergencies again.

**Please note**: This tip/guide is only for when a contractor asks for an extra amount for his problems. Please don't hold the amount you should pay your contractor. I personally never do and never encourage such behavior.
