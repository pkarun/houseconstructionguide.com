I love special sales days like The Big Billon Days or the Great Indian Festival sale.

But I hate these types of sales because they limit how much users can purchase from any bank card or on any one day.

Yes.

We cannot shop as much as we need with discounts on these sale days.

That's disappointing for many users who are looking to buy a lot of things.

That's something that applies to us as well.

We buy lots of items. But to buy all those things, we must ask many friends for debit/credit cards to shop.

This time, my brother collected almost 5 different colleague's debit/credit cards in order to get the maximum discount.

On top of both our debit and credit cards as well.

Whatever the products we ordered yesterday, its delivery also started. From morning onwards, my job is only to collect those delivery items.

This will continue for me for the next few days.

If you still have not started ordering anything yetâ€¦ go ahead and open the Flipkart and Amazon apps to grab some deals.

If you are planning or constructing your house, here is a list of house construction-related items that I recommend you shop online instead of offline shops to save more money.
