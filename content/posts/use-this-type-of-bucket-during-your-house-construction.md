Last Sunday, I went outside to bring mutton. While on the way, I noticed a scrap shop where he kept paint buckets outside.

In our house, we have lots of paint buckets available. We needed to do something about those.

So I asked the scrap shop guy, "How much for a Paint bucket?".

He told me â‚¹50 per bucket.

I was quite shocked listening to the paint bucket price. I was expecting a little bit more costlyâ€¦ Because I need to sell our paint buckets ðŸ™‚

Next, I asked him how much he would buy each bucket.

He said, "â‚¹15 to â‚¹20, depending on the bucket condition."

I told it's in good condition. To which he replied, â‚¹20.

Okâ€¦ I replied and left the spot.

Why I'm sharing this?

The reason isâ€¦ You need a few buckets for the construction work during your house construction.

** Coffee came. 5 min break**

The only buckets I recommend are Painting buckets. These are the only durable buckets suitable for construction-related hard work.

Whatever the other buckets you buy from the shop won't last long.

If you have not yet started, buy paint buckets by asking a few scrap shops or on olx.in.

Even if it costs 100 to 200 per bucket, I recommend paint buckets.

I wish we could get these tips during our construction time.

We wasted a few buckets that we had bought from the shops.

After listening to the â‚¹20 per paint bucket, I better plan to sell all our paint buckets directly to the users on olx.in for a better price.

When I need to sell, I will put it.

Similarly, Whatever the tricks I used to ask for the paint bucket price, I used a similar strategy to find out the real cost of the cement bags.

Usually, most of them never think about it.

This is the kind of cement delivery secret I exploredâ€¦ at least to my knowledge.

After exploring this, I immediately saved â‚¹10 to â‚¹30 per cement bag.

I discovered this secret while constructing my second building after noticing something strange during the cement delivery time.

I shared this inside my Cement Pricing Secrets.

I'm not going to promise it will work for all. To my knowledge, it should work, but I don't want to promise the moon and deliver something.

If it works, You're gonna save a lot on cement. If not, you lose whatever price you paid for the guide. So, I kept the price of the product to just â‚¹299.
