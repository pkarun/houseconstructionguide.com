Few days back I got a below email from one of my customers.

---

Even after sending repeated e mails you have not sent the link. What is the reason?

---

I didn't receive any such emails from this guy. This is the first email I got.

That time, my wife's parents also came home. I spoke to them in the hall when I saw the above email.

I opened my WhatsApp. The same guy texted me there as well.

Angry Customer: I have not yet received the link. I check my email box, including spam. Send it immediately. 

ashokxxxxer@gmail.com

ME: If you already paid, then product access details is sent to your email inbox. 

Please check Inbox/Spam folder for it. 

If you didn't notice then search for email from arun@houseconstructionguide.com to find product access details email.

If you need more help feel free to reach me on WhatsApp: 8088xxxx76

Angry Customer: Don't reply mechanically. I check everything.

ME: K. I will check and update here before 10 pm 

Angry Customer: Very cheap attitude.  After receiving fees you tell a story?

ME: Share screenshot

Angry Customer: See your email

I Tried speaking to him directly. The tone was not good, so I disconnected the call. 

Angry Customer: Return back the payment immediately

ME: share me where should i send the payment

Angry Customer: GPay 98xxxx4372

ME:  Refunded instantly without hesitation 

When I check my email system, it clearly showing the product access details email has already been sent. But this customer doesn't know how to properly check email and complaining to me.

I find many customers complain about not getting the product. 

The main reason is that they missed my email containing product access details.

I try to explain by sending a standard replay to all such customers. Sometimes, I directly speak to them to solve their issue.

Similarly, I tried to call and speak to this guy as well. It looks like his and my standards of speaking don't match.

I Instantly Refunded his Full Purchase Amount.

After he got his refund amount, he went on my Facebook ad and commented below with a fake facebook account:

Angry Customer: Not genuine guy. Received Payment. But not send the link and tell different story. Finally if we ask the reason, he return back the Payment. Buyers be aware. Such peoples bad attitude we hesitate very much to send money. Really pity guy. What genuineness we expect from his product????????

I kept this comment there. 

Why should I don't send the product to buyers? It's a digital product. I don't lose anything by giving access to my product to those who have paid. 

Let's assume I haven't gave him a product access. If he ask politely, I could have resent him again. He simply shouting... and not ready to listen to me at all. 

I don't understand where this type of person is coming from to complain.

I keep my product price a little higher to get better customers. 

I cannot do that in ads. 

I need to make a good offer so people buy instantly, or else I will lose money on ads. 

When we keep low prices, I need to deal with this type of customer patiently. 

Mine is a single-person business. 

I only need to do all A to Z issues. If I get a few such customers, my whole day will get spoiled. 

It's better to eliminate such customers in the initial stage itself.

So, I instantly refunded and added his email to my block list on my email sending server. 

He no longer receives any further communication from me on this Brand.

It's not just about the money… I don't want your money if you are not the right fit for me.

My Products are not all for all. I don't offer refunds on my products. Read the sale page properly, and if it makes sense, then only buy from me.
