Today while having dinner right nowâ€¦ there was a discussion with our family, which is related to - _naming neighbor's newborn baby_.

Which is a perfect topic for my current situation. So I'm sending another email today.

It's just happenedâ€¦

So the thing isâ€¦ our neighbor asked our wife and my brother's wife while walking yesterday to suggest some Good names for his newborn baby boy.

So both of them gave a few name suggestions as he requested.

### Not just Nameâ€¦  
It must be OK with Numerology.

The Neighbour replied, 'We are not just looking for a GOOD NAME only.'

The name should match Numerology as well. That's why it's getting difficult for us to find a good name.

As soon as I heard this talk, I laughedâ€¦ LOL. ðŸ˜€

I just told my readers about the numerology calculator a few minutes back.Â 

And now, I heard our neighbor is also trying to find a numerologically ok name for his son.

Isn't it funny?Â 

I immediately told them you should have told him about my tool built for this task.

All of them laughedâ€¦

Seriouslyâ€¦?? They asked.

YES.

Today only, I sent an email regarding this tool.

Ohhâ€¦Â 

â€¦

â€¦

Anyway, I never thought many of them took numerology so seriously.
