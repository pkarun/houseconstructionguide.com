I'm writing this email after watching a Tamil movie in Kannada language on Amazon Prime Video.

An OTT app which I recently subscribed to watch movies…

After subscribing, every week, all our family members sit in our first building hall and watch movies together.

Sitting with all family members and spending time together is a really good feeling.

Earlier, it was not like that.

It's just parents who used to watch regular dish TV channels and movies, which are always filled with plenty of Ads.

Now, with OTT apps, it's way better experience.

You can enjoy new movies with little or no ads with family…

Isn't it a good feeling?

It is for me.

That's why we are all spending time together now. If it's not OTT apps, we will be minding our own business in front of a computer 24*7.

It's a boring life. Life is meant to be enjoyed… not just work always.

Oh, we don't watch movies quite…, as my younger brother and my kids will always be disturbing. We still somehow manage and watch in that disturbance as well by keeping a little high volume.

Apart from that good disturbance, we thoroughly enjoy movies.

Luckily, in our house, we don't manage a few of our day-to-day tasks, which we need to manage ourselves.

For example, Outdoor lights? It works in Auto mode. We no longer spend time to manage it.

Sump taps? It also works in Auto mode. Our auto unit inside the sump stops water when the sump is full. If your tap is a little below the sump, I have a solution to fix the float value issue as well.

Overhead tank? That also runs with a motor controller unit. Anytime our overhead tanks get empty, it does the job.

If you think you need to spend lots of money to do all this automation… then you are wrong.

All the above automation setups can be done for 1000 to 3000 rs if you plan well during construction time.

If not planned, then it's a different story.

I shared all such preliminary setups that you need to take care of during house construction time inside my guides. And I recommend that everyone implement those suggestions to make their lives easier.

For security 24*7? Our CC cam takes care of everything in the building.

If students need to brun crakers on Terrace, they will first ask me before they do so. Because they know I can see all those activities.

There is nothing they can hide outside their unit.

All are covered under surveillance cameras. If you ask me, it is one of the most worthy investments for any house.

This email is written right after watching a movie. This means it was written yesterday, unlike any of my emails, which I usually write on the same day. Because I was in a good mood to write so. 

That's all for today's email.

Tomorrow, I will share some different thoughts I got an idea from today.

Till then, take care.
