You will do a Housewarming function at the end of your house construction. If this is your first function, then chances of missing a few things might happen…

Instead of regretting after the function was over, I shared lessons learned in this guide.

In this guide, I shared my experience from Date fixing for housewarming functions to shifting to your new house.

This guide is particularly written for Hindus. I don't know how other communities celebrate their housewarming function, so I'm sorry if this guide won't help other community users.

I only shared what I did… I have not learned somewhere else and shared it here.
