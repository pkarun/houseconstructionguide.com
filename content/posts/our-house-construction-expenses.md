Interested in knowing how much we spent on our house construction and where we spent it?

If that's your answer is YES. Then this is something for you.

In this product, I will give access to my Google sheet expenses trackers that I maintained for our house construction.

It took me _3 years to prepare_ this data. Real data.

It contains almost 98% of the expenses we spent on our second house construction with item level price breakup in the Google sheet, so if you need to check a particular price, you can easily search to find its prices in minutes.

Honestly, I'm not comfortable sharing this data…

I may remove this product later if I don't feel like sharing this. But for now, I think it could help someone, so I'm sharing it here.

These are not some made-up data like what you hear from some house owners who tell 30% to 50% more than what they have spent for their construction.

It's real data with product price details as well.

I'm not going to say you will get all the product prices… sometimes I may miss a few prices. So keep that in mind.

I maintained and prepared this data for my future use... I never thought I would hand over this data to other users like this. It was maintained for my usage for my understanding purpose.

This expense doesn't contain interior design expenses yet because we haven't done that yet for our house.

Instead of me talking, let me show what you see inside:

**1) Building Overview:**

In this section, I shared our building details. Without knowing this information, there is no use in seeing the below details. Now you can compare our house construction expenses with your expenses. (Although the price varies a lot based on a lot of factors, you can still keep this as a base rough estimation)

**2) Main House Construction Expenses Sheet:**

![](/images/2023/11/image-7.png)

This Google sheet contains 700+ expenses related to our house construction with price and quantity details.

With the help of a filter on Google sheet, you can easily find out the price we paid for specific Categories, Stores, & Items. I even have some notes section to remember details about the transaction.

**3) Category Billing:**

Here you can see for each category how much we spent on our house in a glance.

**4) Painting Expenses:**

In this section, you will see all the painting items we used for our building with quantity and price details.

**5) Electrical Switches and Plates Price Details:**

These are the list of electrical items that we have used after doing wiring. We used Hi-Fi brand switches. So all the product prices are relevent to Hi-Fi brand.

**6) Electrical Items used During Construction:**

These are the list of electrical items we have used during construction time. Like - as electrical molding items, groove cutting time, etc.,

**7) Plumbing Materials Price Details:**

I tried to keep all the data, but a few might be missing. You can keep 1% or 2% of data that might not be available in my expenses sheet. Because of my busyness, I might forget to miss adding some entries.


**11) House Construction Cost Estimator:**

**Simple Budget Calculation:**
![](/images/2023/11/house-construction-simple-cost-estimation.jpg)

In a simple budget calculation, all you need to do is enter your site width, site length data in feet, and the number of floors you plan to construct. It gives the estimated budget you need based on our construction data.

**Category Wise Calculation:**
![](/images/2023/11/house-construction-cost-estimator.jpg)

Want a little more in-depth cost calculation? Then, category calculation is something you should need to check.

Just enter your RCC to RCC measurement in Sq feet or full site measurement in Sq feet in the header section of the Excel sheet. It will show the category-wise budget you need for your house construction.

In category-wise calculation, I collected and summarised all the major expenses in one entry and showed how much it cost per sq feet.

By knowing each category of how much it costs us in each category, you can get a rough estimate of your construction budget. 

You can easily deduct any category of house construction expenses you don't need (e.g., borewell) from the final calculation. Because now you can see category-wise expense calculations. 

This calculator is built based on data on our house construction expenses. It's not the engineer's calculated expenses sheet.

You can use this to know the rough construction budget. It does not replace the Engineer's calculated house construction expense estimate. 

All expenses are calculated only per square feet basis to make it easier to calculate.
