Today, I'm answering a question from a blog reader.

I kept postponing answering his emails for quite a few days because of the complexity of the email and asking too many questions in one email.

It is really difficult to answer such questions. For now, I will try my best to answer this reader's questions:

Hi Arun,

I recently came across your website. I was looking for some guidance regarding a bda plot I want to purchase from my (retired govt employee) relative as I want to build a house in near future as part of my retirement plans to stay in bangalore. I have a few questions regarding it. I hope you can help me out. Different states have different rules so I am reaching out to you for some guidance.

1. I am currently based in jaipur rajasthan so it is not possible to regularly check if anyone will occupy  my land illegally in future. What can I possibly do to avoid such unwanted circumstances?

2. While consulting different lawyers whether it is regarding document verification or total charges they are charging to make the sale deed and the registration, i observed the charges are not in the same range many are even charging the bribe money that needs to be paid to registrar and other govt officials in order to transfer the property in my name. I want to know what charges that i need to pay and what i can avoid paying. I would also like to know the charges are in what range and is it negotiable. I would like you to share your experience and difficulties you faced while buying a plot in your name. If you have any references of any lawyer I can consult with which you found to be trustworthy or if you have used their services and found them satisfactory and the charges for their services are reasonable enough.

3. After buying a bda plot, what is the procedure to survey the land and then make a boundary wall and how much will it cost and how to get it done? This is to make sure that no one (my future neighbours) constructs their house on my turf by mistake.

4. Any Precautions i have to take to make this deal go smoothly without any hiccups so i don't have to face any legal repercussions in future.If you could list out the documents i must possess after buying the property, it would be very helpful.  

What I am aiming for is to buy a bda plot and build a boundary wall around it and secure all documents so that my rights for that property is secured so that at a later date I can build a house for personal use.

Thank you for your time and I look forward to your guidance/suggestions on my above doubts.

Regards

Ajit Dsouza

Seems like users didnâ€™t appreciate any of my hard work here. He just wants to get an answer for free. ðŸ˜Š

No problem. Letâ€™s try my best.

**1. I am currently based in jaipur rajasthan so it is not possible to regularly check if anyone will occupy  my land illegally in future. What can I possibly do to avoid such unwanted circumstances?**

Few things you can do as of my knowledge

a) Build one shed or temporary house. Take water and power connection and then give it for rent. Ask some neighbours to take care of your property and pay them some fees.

No one would do the work for free.

b) Build a compound, put your contact number on it, and ask a few neighbours to monitor and share your contact numbers with all of them. You also need to be in touch with them.

c) Make a parking spot by cleaning the site. Inform neighbour to park their vehicle and ask them to monitor your property. You are helping them, and they will also help you. Your site will be clean, and someone will proactively use and monitor in this case.

c) You must somehow arrange for someone to monitor your property. It is a must.

In our case, we paid a fee to a lawyer in Lumpsum. We just need to pay whatever fee we discussed, and the lawyer will handle all other things.

Yes, everyone asks for a bribe. Thatâ€™s common. Just pay the bribe and get the work done faster.

**If you have any references of any lawyer I can consult with which you found to be trustworthy or if you have used their services and found them satisfactory and the charges for their services are reasonable enough** 

No. I donâ€™t have any such lawyer. I recommend finding a lawyer near the site. It helps.

**I would like you to share your experience and difficulties you faced while buying a plot in your name.**

I just asked my dad about the details of the fee we paid. If I get post-worthy content, I will post it.

**3. After buying a bda plot, what is the procedure to survey the land and then make a boundary wall and how much will it cost and how to get it done? This is to make sure that no one (my future neighbours) constructs their house on my turf by mistake.**

I havenâ€™t done so I cannot comment.

 

**4. Any Precautions i have to take to make this deal go smoothly without any hiccups so i don't have to face any legal repercussions in future.**

If you are buying a BDA plot, you wonâ€™t face that many problems. Properly consult the site's nearby lawyers, and follow a few tips suggested in 1st point.

 

**If you could list out the documents i must possess after buying the property, it would be very helpful.**

Iâ€™m honestly not eligible to answer these questions. Please consult proper lawyers (2).

We bought revenue site. Here is the document lawyer requested for us: https://houseconstructionguide.com/site-purchasing-document-verification-in-india/

Yours could be different.

**What I am aiming for is to buy a bda plot and build a boundary wall around it and secure all documents so that my rights for that property is secured so that at a later date I can build a house for personal use.**

If possible, build one shed, take the water and power connection, and give it for rent. I not suggesting this idea to make money but to secure your property properly.

 

If you still not yet bought site, I shared few tips in 2019 in the below article:

Based on my current knowledge, I prefer to write a paid guide itself. It's not in my top priority now. 

I learned a lot by seeing problems in my surrounding area people, site owners, site owner mentality etc.,
