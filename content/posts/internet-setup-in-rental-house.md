Today at around 5 PM, I was resting on my bed and scrolling Facebook feed on my mobile.

I got a call from one of my tenant (MCA student) Dad.

Tennant dad: "**_Arun, we need an internet connection today. Can you arrange it?_**"

I said ok, no problem. I will arrange it by 8.30 PM.

No,… our son has a college exam from 6 PM to 8 PM. Can you able to arrange WiFi by 6 PM?

No uncle. Sorry. I cannot be able to arrange it by that time.

We need to do _router configuration_ and all. And it takes some time. I will only be able to do it after my brother returns home.

After thinking for some time…

…they asked for any alternative options you can be able to arrange?

After seeing their urgency… Ok, I will arrange **LAN (wired) connection** now. Later we will make a WiFi arrangement for him.

They said that's ok. I will ask my son to get in touch with you.

Ok, I responded.

Within a few minutes, his son called me… my dad asked to contact you.

Ya… I know.

I asked his son -- "Does your Laptop have Ethernet Port."

Ya. It's available.

Do you have a LAN cable with you?

No… I don't have any.

Okay… then come to the 1st floor. I will give LAN/Internet Cable. For the time being, you can use the Wired connection. At 8:30 PM, we will come and make WiFi arrangements.

He said okay.

I told him… _just connect the cable to Internet Port offered in your Bed room to your Laptop directly. I will do all the setup here._

No extra setup is required on your end.

After a few minutes, I asked, is it working?

**Ya… it's working.**

No configuration…. nothing.

He immediately started enjoying **full high-speed internet from my home to his house** without Dropping Speed. I just connected the LAN cable to the SWITCH setup from our home.

**THIS IS HOW HOME NETWORKING SHOULD BE DONE.**

**NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND.**

I just started working on this guide today... probably one of the costliest and must-have guide to future-proof your house the **RIGHT WAY**.
