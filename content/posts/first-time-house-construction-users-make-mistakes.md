I strongly believe that "everyone makes mistakes in their first house construction".

I did it...

Many of my dad's friends did the same in their new building.

There is another instance I noticed recently near my house. Right in front of my home office window, one building construction is happening...

I didn't understand who the owner of that building was for a few days.

Now that the [building's ground floor moulding](https://houseconstructionguide.com/during-molding-time/) is over, I see one guy coming daily for RCC curing.

RCC curing is the only curing that is easy to do in-house construction. I guess that's why the owner is coming for curing nowadays ðŸ˜„

Anyway...

The owner doing RCC curing already has another building on the same road; as of the public talk, that building has already sold for the 1.65cr range.

I'm not sure about that News.

But what I'm sure is that whatever the building they sold is a brand new building. And it was constructed with extreme care.

In no way did they build that house for selling purposes.

After entering their new house, they realised one BIG MISTAKE related to their Parking.

Within 6 months, the house owner announced that the building was for sale. I noticed some buyers coming and going to that house.

Within a few months, I heard it sold for around 1.65 cr.

Once I heard the news, their family bought another site on the same road and are doing another construction.

I'm unsure who owns that new building and for what purpose they are constructing it.

When they kept their first house for sale then, [I assumed the reason and shared it here in my blog](https://houseconstructionguide.com/new-building-sold-for-parking-mistake/) and with my family.

I believe they sold that House because they made a terrible mistake in their Parking.

I noticed that mistake at the time of construction itself. However, the building owners are first-time owners, so they didn't notice that mistake until they started using their building. Once they noticed, they kept their building for sale in few months. (this is what I believe)

Not everyone will have this type of mentality.

However, the building owners are premium users. Even a small inconvenience is a big inconvenience for them.

In fact, whatever mistake they made in their building related to parking is not a small inconvenience. It's a terriable inconvience.

So, they simply sold the house telling some random reason.

Now...

I passed by the new building they were constructing a few days back.

Here is what I noticed.

This time, they were not making the same mistake they did in their previous/first house, which they sold.

So, is my assumption about the house TRUE?

I don't know about that.

All I can see is that in their new building, they were not making the same mistakes as I noticed in their first building.

In my [Parking Horror](https://houseconstructionguide.com/parking-horror/), I shared photos of their first building and their parking mistake.

If you are an All-Access Pass user, visit the 5.2 section and see the mistake yourself.

Don't make such a stupid mistake when constructing your house.

The user who ever bought that house may not yet be aware of that parking mistake until he starts using that house, I guess.

I shared what I did and what others usually make in their first construction without their knowledge.
