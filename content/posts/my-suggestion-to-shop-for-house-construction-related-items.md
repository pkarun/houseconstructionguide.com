Want the best deals on the product you purchase for house construction-related stuff? Then shopping for products near your building shops is the right way for the most part.

[Apart from cement bags](https://houseconstructionguide.com/cement-pricing-secrets/), I recommend everyone to shop from the nearest shops to purchase house construction-related items.

It helps in a lot of ways.

Because when you are building your house, you may need to bring so many items from a shop.

If you thought you would buy in bulk all at once from a wholesale shop and avoid shopping from the nearest shop, then this is simply impossible.

You always miss or need many more req'd items that you didn't buy.

Now for that small item, you cannot go to a wholesale shop that is a little far away from your building.

When you visit the nearest shop to buy those items, those guys will tell you higher prices than the regular price because they know you are not their regular customer and are shopping elsewhere.

And the [convience of shopping from nearby shopping](https://houseconstructionguide.com/why-you-should-shop-nearby-offline-shops/) cannot be underestimated.

We always bought all our construction-related materials from a nearby one shop.

Believe it or not, they gave us the highest discount compared to other customers who do price shopping from different shops.

We never bothered to ask for prices from different shops.

We have a very good relationship with the store owner (after buying, not before), so we don't ask him the price before buying the products. Very few times we do ask, just to know.

We order, he delivers products to our doorstep.

Starting time, we did compared prices when building our first house…

For the second house…. no one can beat his price—no more worries about searching cheapest vendor.

Takeaway?

Always shop from the nearest shop. It helps.
