When we were building our first house, we were complete newbiesâ€¦ 

We didn't have many ideas about contractors, labourers, etc.; we simply went with the construction flow. 

Luckily, one of our dad's friends helped in most aspects of our construction. 

Everything went well in most cases, apart from the Electrical contractor. We had a lot of issues and verbal fights with the electrical contractor for various reasons.

In short, he doesn't know much. 

We hired him just because of my dad's friend's recommendation, and he was his own brother. So we hired him to do the electrical work.

We later learned our lesson.

Out of many mistakes made by our first building electrical contractor, he made a few particular mistakes related to AC. 

Although we still did not yet use any AC in our first building, we noticed all such issues later when we started using the building. 

When we learned about that issue, we again hired a talented second-building electrical labourer to fix all the issues in the first building. We know that we have to fix all those issues at any cost. 

Luckily, he did fix all of such issues at a price.

These are all must-have things you should know when you are building a house. 

If you simply rely on contractor knowledge, you are the one who is going to suffer later. 

If you have all the basic knowledge that you need to know at the time of construction, you could simply avoid a lot of problems after the construction and save money to fix such issues later. 

I wish someone could have written a guide something specifically for new house construction users like what I did in my guides.

That's why I'm writing all the costly lessons that I learned in my paid product one by one so you can learn and avoid such mistakes.

All these are written from my personal experience. 

In my [AC Guide](https://houseconstructionguide.com/products/#20-ac-guide), 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9 are the few points you should remember when your Electrical Contractor doing work so he don't make mistakes. 

Even our second building's talented electrical contractor made some mistakes related to AC. So, I don't recommend you rely on just contractor knowledge to execute your project.

Have your own knowledge or take the help of someone who did what you are planning to do.
