Got the below email from one of my [All-Access Pass customers](https://houseconstructionguide.com/products/) few days back:

Hello Arun

In one of the post I saw that you have given guidance to one of the user on a physical meeting. I am also planning to build a house which is west and north corner plot and I got plan from an architect but I just want to show you the plan and take the recommendations. Kindly let me know if itâ€™s possible for a meeting. You can charge for the consultation. Kindly let me know. I strongly believe that your recommendations will definitely help me.

Regards

In one of the post I saw that you have given guidance to one of the user on a physical meeting.

Yesâ€¦. yesâ€¦ ðŸ™‚

I remember that.

One guy did call me to take guidance physicallyâ€¦ I informed them I would do it at a cost.

The guy immediately agreed and informed me in full Josh that he would happily pay more than what I asked. Seriously! 

I Said okay and told him to prepare his questions and fix one day we would meet.

After that, I didn't hear anything from that guy. I don't follow up on such requests.

I guess the user probably dropped meeting me. We never met yet.

The good thing is, this guy didn't waste my time that much. I guess we spoke for 5 to 10 minutes on a Phone call, and after that, we never communicated.

I had another similar incident happen a few days back.

One guy requested 1 hr of my time for consultation. This user has tried asking me twice already. Once, a few months before, I said no.

He contacted me again a few days back.

This time, I said yes.

I shared that my fee for 1 hr consultation is â‚¹5000. He also agreed, but he didn't make payment after wasting some time.

This was also cancelled. I didn't follow up as usual.

So, based on my previous experience and my personal preference, consultation is not something worth it to me at this moment.

Maybe it may also not be worth it to other party as well, based on my Fees.

I am also planning to build a house which is west and north corner plot and I got plan from an architect but I just want to show you the plan and take the recommendations.

Good, you consulted Architect.

I hope you already went through my guides. I'm sharing all my knowledge with my All-Access Pass. (still not yet completed)

I recommend you to go through those guides multiple times and apply them to avoid making many mistakes and save money in your house construction process.

Kindly let me know if a meeting is possible. You can charge for the consultation. Kindly let me know. I strongly believe that your recommendations will definitely help me.

Thanks for Trusting me.

It definitely means a lot. That, too, someone who paid for my product and asking for consultation is not something I take easily.

Based on my past consultation time-wasting request experience and my personal preference, I have to say no.

Moreover, My charges are quite high. I'm not sure I can deliver the valve for what I charge.

Charging less is also not worth considering as my personal time is involved, and it's not scalable.

So, from both user's points of view, I would say no for now.
