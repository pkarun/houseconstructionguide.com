Constructing a House and don't have UGD and want to build a Septic tank? Then this guide is something for you…

In this guide, I will share my small insight on how to plan, what things need to be taken care of, how much depth your toilet pit needs to have, how not to waste money, outlet pipe arrangement ideas, etc. 

This guide is written from my personal experience.

We used a pit cleaning service once in our house, and after that, I learned something I never knew about. 

After learning those things, I'm writing a guide on this topic and sharing that knowledge with you so you can save money and handle any pit maintenance without much stress.

This requires little planning.

Some users overestimate this. Some users underestimate this.

You don't need to be in any of the above users. You should plan very well so that you don't need to worry much when a pit cleaning service is required.

Overestimate users face lifelong issues… 

Underestimated users must spend money, time and effort when pit cleaning is required.

If you plan the right way, you will not face issues like how overestimated users face for life, and you also won't face any issues like how underestimated users face during maintenance time.

That's what this guide is going to do…

I'm not going to share any big theory here. 

I'm just going to share things you need to be aware of so that you make your life easier for the rest of your life.

Most first-time house construction users are unaware of these things or don't think much about the future. When their toilet pit got full, when they needed to call a pit cleaning service that time they realise their mistake.

Don't be like that.

That's going to be a little expensive mistake. 

Not just that. 

If you don't plan properly or don't know what you need to know, you need to arrange a labourer when it's time for pit cleaning.

And, hopefully, you are aware of how difficult it is to arrange labour for 1 day's work… 

If you don't want to be in that situation, and when pit cleaning is required, handle like a hassle-free, this guide is something for you.

I have gone through this cycle myself. I learned some lessons, and I'm sharing them with you here.
