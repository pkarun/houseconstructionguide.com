Yesterday, all our family members went to Beegara Oota in Hassan.

On the way, we decided to visit some temples.

One such spot we choose is Panchamukhi Anjaneya Swamy -Temple, Bidanagere, Kunigal Tq.

It was having good reviews. It has a big god idol on top of the building. It's like a visitor's attraction point. So we decided to go once.

As soon as we reached near the spot, we could see a big idol. It's looking good.

We took some photos and went inside.

As soon as we started entering the temple, we started to experience bad because of the priests.

Inside the temple, all priests are trying to scam all the visitors by asking them to do something and then asking for a fee for doing such things.

Usually, it consists of saying something without talking about fees. They act like it's a procedure and will demand fees once the task ends.

Users who listen to priests words get scammed listening to their words.

One of the worst temple experiences I have ever had recently.

I also got scammed like this inside the temple for ₹50.

You may feel it's just ₹50. It could be. But the feeling of getting scammed by unknown people doesn't feel good.

Once I realised I got scammed, I got alerted. And never bothered to stand or listen to any priests inside the temple.

Again, a few priests tried to scam me with different offerings at a higher price point. I had already been scammed once, so I didn't listen to anyone.

Once I came outside the temple, my brother and dad shared a similar experience.

I opened Google Maps reviews to see what others share; all the latest reviews share their scam experience inside the temple.

Now, understand what they are doing in the name of God.

I left the temple feeling very bad for getting scammed.

This reminded me of my first house construction, where an electrical contractor scammed us with extra charges. We trusted his words but ended up overpaying because nothing was in writing.

A good way to avoid contractor scams is to have a written contract agreement. Which clearly outlines the contract work scope, payment terms, exit terms, etc., in a written agreement.

Now… I will make a special and limited-time offer where you can get all the labour contract agreement templates I have prepared based on my construction experience.

It's only available for 3 days. After that, I will take it down.
