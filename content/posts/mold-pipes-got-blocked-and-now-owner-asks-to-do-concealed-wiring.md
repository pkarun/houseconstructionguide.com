This incident was recently explained by our electrical laborer who is doing some old building electrical alteration work.

That old building is none other than the cement trader shop where we used to buy cement first.Â 

Until today, the building owner did open wiring for temporary purposes for his shopâ€¦Â  but now, he wants his commercial shop to rent to others, so he is preparing that unit. So they used our electrical contractor to spice up the rental unit to make it modern.

### **Unfortunatelyâ€¦. our talented electrician told  
"NOT POSSIBLE"**

As soon as the electrician started working on that building, he noticed one of the main problems done by the old electrical contractor/some labor.

The main problem he noticed isâ€¦Â **All the mold pipes got blocked**.

And now the owner is asking to do all the wiringÂ _concealed itself_.

Because most of his mold pipes got blockedâ€¦ electrician cannot make any alternative solution apart from doing open system wiring.

Imagine some new building with open system wiringâ€¦Â ðŸ¤¦

I don't know which electrician he used while doing RCC molding time. Now when he wanted to wire for his building, the problem started.

### **The owner could Prevent this issue from happening  
if he knew this knowledge**

At least if that owner knew a few basic things he needed to check while doing RCC molding time, he could prevent such pipe blocking.

In our first building, some of our RCC electrical pipes got blocked. But luckily, not all mold pipes are blocked. So our electrician somehow managed to do concealed wiring.

At that time, we didn't know much about things we needed to check while doing RCC time.

Now we have.

In the second building, we got only 1 or 2 pipe block complaints for a 3-floor building. That's it.

Even if you hire a good electrician, I still recommend you to know few basic knowledge.

One thing you should always keep in mind is, No one cares about your building as much as you.

You should always watch all the work to ensure everything is going right.

If something goes wrong at the final time, laborers simply tell Sorry, Sir.

At the end of the day, you are the one who is going to suffer because of the contractor/laborer's mistake.

In my Electrical Work Guide, I shared a few things you should know while doing RCC molding time. Refer to 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 5.8, 5.9, 5.41, and 5.51 points to prevent such issues.
