Today, I got the below WhatsApp message from one of my customers:

Customer: Hey good morning Arun.

Customer: I [bought one of your expense calculators](https://houseconstructionguide.com/our-house-construction-expenses/), and it is very detailed. Thank you very much.

Customer: I am right now signing a contract with my contractor and just getting quotes.

Customer: I wanted to check if you could help out with a contract draft that I use.

No. I don't offer 1 on 1 support.

Instead, you can go through [my Building Contractor Guide](https://houseconstructionguide.com/building-contractor-guide/), where I shared many tips for framing a good building labour contract.

I don't have any standard contractor agreement format.

Most of the time, your building contractor won't understand my language. And I cannot make an agreement in all the languages.

So, Instead of giving a standard contractor agreement format, what I'm doing is… I'm sharing some important points you must mention in the agreement.

By this way… No matter what the agreement, your contractor can bring. Include the points I shared in my guide inside your building contractor agreement.

By including those points, you will safeguard yourself.

Those are the points where the difference between you and the contractor usually arises.

And most first-time owners aren't even aware of those things. This is a plus for the contractor to make more money or trouble owners (depending on the contractors) once construction starts.

Apart from framing contract tips, I also have a lot of general construction tips as well. Learn and avoid making them when you are constructing your building.

Hope it helps.
