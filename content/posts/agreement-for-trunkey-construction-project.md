I got a few such requests.

I don't have any such agreement prepared for a material contract or turnkey construction project.

At least, Not at the moment.

It is because "it's really difficult to properly create a detailed agreement in such projects".

No matter how good you are, your chances of missing a few specifications will always be high.

If those things are not mentioned in writing, what will happen?

The difference between owners and contractors will start.

That's why most material contract projects have some kind of disputes.

Andâ€¦

Honestly, I don't want to be a part of such disputes. That's why I simply say NO.

Some readers are interested in going with material contracts for their house construction.

If that's your plan, I have a small tip for you.

When choosing a material contractor, ask the contractor to show any recently completed material contract projects and discuss with such owners before finalizing the contractor.

The project should be completed. Not work in process projects. Because most disputes happen at the end of the construction stage. Not during the construction stage.

You can read one of our relative's stories who went with a material contract for their building recently here.

If you still have no choice, take your engineer's help to verify the contract agreement terms and conditions.
