We have 1 unit available from next month onwards so we put To-Let board on the building.

Just few minutes before, two college girls came to see the property. 

I went to show the property, they also liked it but they asked one request...

That is, they want one extra walldrop as our walldrop which is not sufficient for 3 persons. 

I said No. We cannot do that. 

But their request is a valid request. This is not the first request we got about walldrop small query. Specially, this is a common issue when 2 or 3 girls planning to stay in our rental unit. 

Honestly, I felt the same. 

I wish we could have though about this when we were constructing our house. 

See... We are only giving our property for rent to college students. And almost all college student never used the pooja room in our rental units.

If we used our brain during construction time we could have avoided the pooja room and used that space for walldrop. 

Now we cannot do that. 

No matter how good you are, it's pretty common to make these kind of simple mistakes during house construction time.

I shared all such similar mistakes [inside my paid guides](https://houseconstructionguide.com/products/#all-access-pass).
