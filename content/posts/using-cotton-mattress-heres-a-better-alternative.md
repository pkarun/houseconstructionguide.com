Today, as soon as I woke, I got a different energy to start working on my new "Rental Property Guide" guide.

This is a guide I'm writing for someone who is planning to start house construction with rental properties in it.

After managing 16-door rental units, I'm dumping all my knowledge on this guide. I'm not sure when I'm going to release it. It will come soon.

Ok…

Today, one of our tenants (a student) asked me to collect his mattress as he won't be available.

** My daughter came, so I took a 15-minute break **

This is the same mattress my brother is also using. After using it for a few days here and there, I can say… it's really better to opt for a wake-fit mattress than a cotton mattress.

In fact, my mom was also impressed by this Wakefit mattress sleeping experience.

Currently, I'm using a cotton mattress.

After experiencing wake fit, I regretted getting a custom cotton mattress.

With a cotton mattress, the bed becomes uneven after sleeping for a few days, and you will get body pain from sleeping on it.

However, the Wakefit bed has not yet changed its structure after being used for a few years.

If you plan to buy a mattress, I wouldn't recommend using a normal cotton mattress. Instead, go with any wake-fit type of mattress.

Other brands could offer similar features, but I'm not sure how long they last.

Sleeping with a wake fit is different from sleeping on a cotton mattress.

If you haven't experienced it, give it a try. You will love it.

Oh, by the way, this is not sponsored by the WakeFit brand. I'm sharing my experience after using it for a few days (my brother one).

Even I plan to change my bed with a wake fit one. But the current one will get idle, so I'm waiting…

So I'm writing here to share my experience so you could avoid buying cotton mattress on your new building if in case you wanted to.
