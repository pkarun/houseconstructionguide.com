If you plan to use an inverter set up in your house, I have one tip to share today.

The tip is to buy BLDC fans when buying a fan. Especially if you are going to have an inverter set up in your house. 

The reason is that BLDC fans run longer periods compared to normal fans when a power cut happens. 

Your inverter battery gives you a much longer backup time.  

This suggestion is not only for inverter setup users. Even if you don't have an inverter setup, you should also buy these modern BLDC fans to save cost on power bills. 

I personally use these [Atomberg BLDC fans](https://www.amazon.in/s?k=atomberg+bldc+fan&crid=N241AN3MOTEA&sprefix=atomberg+b%2Caps%2C207&linkCode=ll2&tag=newsite0003-21&linkId=d5b942091638dbf525096206aa0db894&language=en_IN&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) in my house. Till now, they are performing absolutely fine without having any issues. 

BLDC fans are a little bit more expensive than regular fans. If your budget permits, you should buy these without any hesitation.

I plan to change our first building's normal fans to BLDC fans, as these fans give better battery backup when power failure happens. 

These fans also come with a remote (at least for Atomberg fans). That's another advantage. You don't need to get up to change fan speed. You can keep the fan remote right next to youâ€¦ 

When you have an inverter and power failure happens, running low-power-consuming devices is important to keep the battery back for longer. At that time, these BLDC fans do little wonders.
