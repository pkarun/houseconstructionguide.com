When we built our first building, I noticed one task which is a boring, painful and time-consuming task we were doing is… Switching On/Off of our outdoor lights.

After noticing this pain, I thought of doing something about this. That time, I got a few ideas I could try, and I experimented with those. 

Some of those different ideas felt worth implementing in our second building. 

Initially, I used my own self-made IoT devices to do automation in my first and second buildings. That initial version of the automation device requires a lot of tech and some tech knowledge to maintain and operate it.

For this reason, I never thought of teaching it here. 

Recently, I came across another device that is easy and cheap to operate, and I implemented that in both houses. I'm happy with how the device works. So now I decided to share this knowledge here.

No matter what devices come into the market, if you follow my guide and what I teach inside this material, you can easily switch from one tech to another without much strain.

I tried many different automation stuff in my home because I built both houses with all these automation requirements in mind. If anything new tech comes, it's easy for me to implement in our home. 

The reason? I perpared the right environment at the time of our house construction.  

If you have not yet built your house and you need to adopt such automation, then in this guide, I will share all the things that you need to take care of during your house construction stage.

If you follow this guide during your house construction time, then you will save a lot of time and headaches when you plan to implement any type of automation for your outdoor lights later.

This guide is specifically designed to automate only outdoor lights. 

This guide is not suitable for any Indoor lights.
