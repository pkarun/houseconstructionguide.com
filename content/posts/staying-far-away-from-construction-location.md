If you plan to construct your house, you may need to relocate from your current location in most cases. If that is the case, then read this article to consider my suggestion.

#### Want to relocate Before the Beginning of your House Construction?

If in case you need to relocate from your current location to a new location where you planned to construct your house, then I have a few suggestions I would like to recommend.

**Always take a rental house near your site location**. It really helps in saving in many ways. When you begin your house construction activity, you may need to visit a house construction spot to give coffee/tea, house curing purposes, to give tools, and for many other reasons, you need to frequently visit. If your house is far away from the current construction location, then you will be wasting a lot of your time, energy, and money.

I highly recommend you to take rental house very nearest to your construction location. Nearest doesn't mean 1/2 km or 1 km. Nearest means, from your rental house you should be able to easily watch your site, construction materials, shed, laborers, etc., as easily as possible.

If the nearby rental house is a little costlier, small in size, not a good house, lack of features, owner very strict, etc., also, I still recommend you take rental house nearest to your construction spot.

House construction takes a minimum of 1 year, and during this time you visit your construction spot many times. If you take the rental house near to the construction spot, it greatly helps.

Again, **near means you should be able to see your construction spot** as easily as possible.
