Like every month this month, the bribe-paying time came.

I saw our waterman going on bike backside of our house from my CCTV. He also goes slowly when it's time to get paid.

Who doesn't love to get paid? All love it.

I called him to come and collect his monthly bribe.

He came. As always, he opened our sump cover to check the water level in the sump.

This time, the sump was quite empty.

I asked him why you didn't leave enough water this month.

He replied, "Bore is having an issue".

I told him not to turn off the water to our line as our water level is low on our sump.

He also told Ok, inform me when your sump is full like he told me first.

He immediately realised we don't get noticed when our sump is full because of sump automation.

To which I said, Yes. We don't notice when the sump is full as it shuts off the tap automatically when the sump is full.

Ok, no issues. He took his bike and left the spot.

Yesterday and today, he left the water in our area, listening to my words, which filled our sump.

If we don't pay him.. he suddenly create artifical scarcity and close valves.

We don't have time or energy to deal with the government to fix the problem.

That's why we promptly pay every month, and he also takes care of it without any issues, even when real scarcity comes.

One important thing you must remember is that no matter how much your waterman cooperates with you. You should follow some of the best practices to ensure water comes to the sump at a good pressure when the waterman opens the valve.

Many don't pay attention to that point while constructing their house.

Once they notice that their sump tap water is not coming properly, that time they try to fix the problem.

Most of the problems they try are temporary solutionsâ€¦It's not a permanent solution.

And spend thousands of rupees fixing the water issue.

It happened in many of my neighbour's houses. I already shared their stories earlier.

If you don't want to make such mistakes, here are some of the best practices you need to do while constructing a sump and enjoy good water flow to your sump.
