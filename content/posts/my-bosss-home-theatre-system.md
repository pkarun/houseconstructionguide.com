When I was working long back in a company, my cool & young boss invited all the employees to their housewarming function.

I also visited that time.

It's a luxurious house.

Their house had a dedicated home theatre room. They also had a thread mill setup in that room so they could watch while walking on the thread mill.

At that time, no such popular OTT apps were available. It's only YouTube, which they can watch.

When I and my colleagues saw the setup, we thought, who will have time to watch this and all…

Now I understood why they did that.

It's entertainment at home without wasting time and energy by going to the theatre.

They have good reason to spend time in that home theatre by now.

Now, tech has improved significantly, and many new OTT apps are on the market.

Unlimited Internet at good speed is also available on the market.

This means that any new movies that get released, they can sit in their home and watch & enjoy with the whole family.

Now, you might also think similar to what I was thinking at that time. If you think like that, it's just a matter of time before you change your opinion.

Now, I have changed mine after going through these personally. You might already, or you will one day.

My point in writing this email is that if you have a budget, have a separate room for the home theatre.

If you plan to do that later… then have a floor or room for it. You can set it up later when you have a budget.

If you don't have space, budget, or provision, you can plan your hall with a [bigger 4K TV](https://www.amazon.in/s?k=4k+smart+tv&rh=p_72%3A1318476031&dc=&crid=11BKVZ2RJCMUP&qid=1730814612&rnid=1318475031&sprefix=4K%2Caps%2C234&ds=v1%3AkgLQpiMpm4UXy146LsHSPs9sGh8fkHqdvMt6UQ2dYNM&linkCode=ll2&tag=newsite0003-21&linkId=38bdb4c462cbb55ca13377b94d0da681&language=en_IN&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) and [sound system to enjoy the theatre experience.](https://www.amazon.in/Sony-HT-S20R-Soundbar-Bluetooth-Connectivity/dp/B084685MT1?crid=3DYJA9258WK83&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ZM-4CVTfULqB6jxUj7Mp8LCqTZ4S6haIgbmOVE0onE0gp-AYSvZouI_h6I26lDzslRPgToZhVgEkStV1dXzX6osa7t340lLQvMYUghZfBf16Tmga9Q4QMM_CaAxziDqPFWfaqmitWQc7XrrmahGoDedeYK6N-5zriZ7Q1LJC-gLMLrbNIZznr8-GqDbiXcaQL2YlYevSMaq5yQjQD-3Pw4-2XFrKeFupnY772peAloI.OKc2ZsoGUux1n6MwgTnf849P75nq24RfGINDUS8PAE8&dib_tag=se&keywords=SONY%2BHT-S20R%2B5.1ch&nsdOptOutParam=true&qid=1730728398&sprefix=sony%2Bht-s20r%2B5.1ch%2B%2Caps%2C186&sr=8-1&th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=newsite0003-21&linkId=24fc193cac16bce75d32d583b178b3e2&language=en_IN&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)

And [a good network to set up](https://houseconstructionguide.com/internet-everywhere/) to watch 4K movies without any buffering.

Currently, we have to use the last option at home. Still, we enjoy it a lot weekly, once or twice. Watching the latest movies sitting right in our first house hall…

When building your home, choose the option that best suits you.

These days, my dad spends more time alone watching all pending Kannada movies when our kids won't be there. For this reason, my mom gets angry about watching movies without her :)

Anyway, If you have any questions, feel free to reply.

That's all I wanted to share.
