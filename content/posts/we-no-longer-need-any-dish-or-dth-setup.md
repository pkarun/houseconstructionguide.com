To this day, we have been using a non-smart TV.

For this sale on Amazon and Flipkart, we ordered a good smart TV and a home theatre to go with it.

Both came.

We installed our smart TV and plugged our 400 Mbps internet cable to see its performance on a 4K TV.

I was slightly sceptical about its performance as my single internet connection is shared with all my rental property (16 doors + 2 owner house).

And that all our tenants are college students. If you know college students… you know they always have something to download.

When I play some 4K videos on our new 55-inch TV, that video comes without any buffering.

We have removed the DTH we were using with our old TV.

Usually, only my dad and mom watch TV. And they have few requirements.

They watch a few serials and some Kannada news channels. Now, with our internet connection, their serials come with some OTT apps.

And regarding Kannada news? They are now watching it on the YouTube app.

So their requirements are finished. They are watching it in HD video on the internet without any buffering.

They enjoy TV on the Internet rather than on the DTH connection.

Moreover, with plenty of OTT apps, they can also watch some good serials and movies of very good quality whenever needed and whatever movie they want.

Some have even 4K quality videos.

When asked about the dish/DTH setup, they said we don't need it now.

The picture quality 4K videos on TV are simply awesome. Watching videos itself is a pleasure.

By the way, we didn't connect our Smart TV with the WiFi option. We used a LAN connection.

That's the recommended way to get a good-speed internet connection.

If you think wifi will do its job… You are wrong.

A wired connection always beats a WiFi connection anytime and every time.

I never expected I would be able to replace DTH with an Internet setup. But I did plan to have an internet connection all over the building.

It looks like it's helping us stop the DTH recharge.

By the way, it's already almost 1 week, and we have not yet connected our DTH cable to the TV.

Our Smart TV runs completely on the Internet without any signs of buffering.

I guess I won't be going back to any DTH service anymore.

If you are building a new house, plan the right way to have a proper network setup all over the building.

This is another advantage I'm experiencing because of having a proper network setup all over my building.

I will soon be selling my old TV with my DTH setup. We no longer require both of them.

If you also want to implement such a setup in your house, I shared all my knowledge in my Internet Everywhere Guide.

This setup requires some internet service provider with high-speed internet and unlimited data, or you won't be able to enjoy this.

Fortunately, Excitel internet service is available in my area, and I'm using it fully.

Oh.. by the way. Don't be disappointed if no Internet service provider offers unlimited internet in your area.

None of them were available in our area when we were constructing our house. Still, I implemented Internet all over my building.

Now, Excitel has come, and they are offering an awesome plan.

You cannot implement it once construction work is over, even if you want to. So implement at the time of construction itself, and when it comes, you can also enjoy…

After watching movies on my TV, I'm already falling in love with it. I'm the guy who never watched TV for almost a decade.

I fell in love after enjoying the video quality with sound effects with the new home theatre system.

From now on, I plan to watch new movies weekly once with my family.

Everyone sitting in the same room and watching something is a different feeling.

Oh… It's too much to explain all of this in an email.

Anyway, [don't forget to install Internet Allover in your building.](https://houseconstructionguide.com/internet-everywhere/)

A smart TV without High-Speed internet is like a smartphone without internet/mobile data.
