Listening to experienced contractors and getting their advice when building your house is common. 

That's what I also did. 

I listen to my plumbing contractor and his labourers' suggestions for a few concepts.

Looks like our contractors experimented his new suggestion implementing it in our building.

When we tested it, it didn't work as per our expectations.   

Most of the suggestions given by plumbing contractors are based on their assumptions. 

It's not based on science, even from experienced contractors. So, I recommend that when taking any ideas from plumbers or labourers, don't take them seriously.

Instead of directly implementing their advice, which costs money, I recommend you consult your engineer once or do your own research. Especially suggestions that work on science-based concepts. 

I learned this from my experience after taking an experienced plumbing contractor's suggestion. 

Most of them don't know what science tells them about the topics. They think whatever they assume is right. 

I'm not going to explain what suggestions I took went wrong hereâ€¦

All you need to remember is to take your plumber's suggestion with a grain of salt. Which includes [increasing water pressure in the building as well](https://houseconstructionguide.com/water-pressure/).
