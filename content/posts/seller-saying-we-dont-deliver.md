A few days back, we ordered bulk Diwan cots for our rental property… 

32+2=34 cots.

My dad and brother both discussed the terms with the cot maker and gave advance. 

They discussed all these with their cot seller's dad.

After multiple follow-ups… the 1st batch of cot delivery date came. When my dad called them, the cot seller said we don't offer free delivery and demanded an extra fee.

My dad clearly told them we discussed with your dad that you need to deliver without any additional charges. But his son is not ready to accept it, saying it will be a loss for them, so they cannot do that…

After some back and forth, finally, his son got convinced and sent the delivery.

We had the price in writing but never mentioned the delivery point. 

The discussion gap is not too long. We placed the order only a few days ago, and now the seller is saying we don't offer delivery. 

Clear written communication or proof is very important for both parties' safety when doing any kind of transaction. 

One such way is having a proper written agreement for all the contract work.

Most of them don't have any agreement with their contractors because they don't get any proper agreement, and many skip this step.

Don't do like that.

People can change at any moment, but written words don't. 

I have prepared an owner-friendly labour contract agreement template for all construction contract work from my construction experience. 

This includes work scope, price details, payment terms and more. 

My agreement templates mention all the things that need to be in an agreement. 

If this is your first construction, [my labour contract agreements templates](https://houseconstructionguide.com/products/) definitely gonna help you.
