I'm writing this email today after having tea with a little more sugar, which my mom always does anytime she prepares.

Today, the construction building, which is happening right in front of my home office, did a material shifting and pillar work with the gang team.

This construction is happening in half site. Today, whatever the pillar work they have done is for the 4th floor!

Yup! G+3+1 construction going on.

This is the only residential building with a G+4 floor in our area.

I don't know if the owner knew some rules regarding building height.

Even if he doesn't know now, he will surely come to know when he applies for a permanent power connection.

When files go to the BESCOM office, they see the building size and come for measurement with a big team.

Almost 5+ people came to take the measurements in our building, and that too after duty hours.

Our building is on the border to their rules, so they came and measured every inch of our building for 1 or 2 hours.

They didn't find any deviation and left.

For the G+4 building, they surely wait for their extra paycheck by telling rules and violations.

To my knowledge, this building is only for owner stay. Due to the small size site, they are building more floors.

Using stairs all the time is not an easy task. And maintaining unused floors is also not an easy task. Just imagine maintaining G+4 floorsâ€¦

I will wait and see what happens in their case.

When constructing our building, we also planned for a G+4 floor building.

Planning was also done for G+4; before starting our construction, we learned a few rules through our engineer.

After getting to know them, we immediately dropped the plan and went with G+3.

I shared more details about this in my Electrical work guide.

Make sure to know what you need to know before starting a construction work.
