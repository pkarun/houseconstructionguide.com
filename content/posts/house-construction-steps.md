In house construction, mainly 2 types of construction contract contractors currently doing. They are..

**1) Labour Contract**

In a Labour contract, the contractor's job is to supply labor's and get the construction job done.

Here in this type of contract, the owner has to supply contract required materials (cement, steel, bricks, etc.,) and the contractor supplies his laborer to construct a house.

In labour contract, contractor don't take any responsibility on construction matrials.

**2) Material Contract**

In Material contracts, contractors handle both construction materials and laborers as well.

In this type of contract, your job is to monitor the construction process that's it.

In material contract, your involvement is quite less compared to labor contract work.
