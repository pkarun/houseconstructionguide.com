Choosing a good contractor is definitely more important than choosing a good agreement.

A good contractor can make a lot of adjustments to his work scope.

Still, it's always better to have a proper responsibility in written format than just taking it for granted.

We don't know what happens once the work starts.

I remembered one bad incident in my first house construction experience for this context.

We picked an electrical contractor based on the recommendation of my dad's very good friend, who is his own brother.

Everything was good until we started questioning his work quality…

Slowly, our relationship with our electrical contractor started falling apart.

We had a few verbal fights during the construction period.

During the final settlement, he simply demanded extra payment, saying, This is extra, and that is extra….

He even questioned what proof we have.

That's when I started implementing House Construction Tracking System in my second building.

Thankfully, it also helped in a few such incidents during the construction of my second building.

After learning lessons from my first construction, I implemented everything in written format.

Only my building contractor has an agreement format; the rest are written in a diary with important contract details.

Because building contractors is one of the most expensive things, we went with the agreement format, which was bought by my contractor.

If you see my agreement, it contains only a few details and favours my contactor.

It is not an owner-friendly contract.

In my building contractor guide, I explained all the important points that must be included in the agreement.

Now, I have prepared the Labour contract agreement template itself. All you need to do is modify the template according to your requirements.

The agreement comes inside my building contractor guide. If this is something you are interested in, visit the below link:
