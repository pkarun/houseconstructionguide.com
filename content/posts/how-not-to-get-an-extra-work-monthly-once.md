Today, outside my home office window, I noticed that a construction building made two mistakes related to the meterbox.

So I opened my Electrical Work Guide to check if I mentioned that point or notâ€¦

When I searched, I noticed one point had already been added, but no images had been added, and another point had not been added. Now that also mentioned.

I went back to my second building, took a photo of the mistake they made, and added it to the document in the 5.53 section (redownload again to see updated content).

By the way, this is not their first building.

They recently built one beautiful house on the same road with great care. However, as soon as they entered the house, they sold the building within a few months.

That building not even completed 1 year.

I already written about it earlier. If you are interested in learning more, please [visit this article.](https://houseconstructionguide.com/new-building-sold-for-parking-mistake/)

Whatever mistake they make now will cause extra work for them monthly once they enter the house this time.

By this, I can conclude that just having construction experience is not enough to identify mistakes. We need to have an extra eye and thinking knowledge.

One way you can improve your ability to identify such mistakes is [by reading the guides that I have written.](https://houseconstructionguide.com/products/)

It's not an encyclopedia.

It's a simple guide with straightforward concepts shared with images wherever applicable.
