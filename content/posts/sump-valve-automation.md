Once we entered our first building after house construction was over, the issue I noticed was operating the Sump Valve every week.

I was the only guy who needed to monitor and operate the sump valve On/Off every time… because I'm the guy who works from my home office and stays at home.

So, every week, I need to turn off my sump valve when water starts overflowing from our sump.

Within a few days again, I need to Turn On my sump valve without forgetting, or else we won't get water. 

This operating valve task started happening almost frequently, and I got tired of manually operating the sump valve on/off.

I noticed that only one solution is available to automate the sump valve process in the market. 

That is a standard float valve.

The problem with the standard float valve is that it won't allow a tap to fill my sump.

Our sump tap is kept a little down inside the sump, so if we install a regular sump float valve, it stops filling the water on the tap keeping almost 4 feet empty from the top of the sump.

That's a lot of water storage space wasted inside my sump.
Depending on your sump capacity, even 1 feet is a lot of space. 

So, this standard float valve is not something I need.

Once I got fed up with operating the sump valve… I decided to do something to FIX this problem seriously.

I started researching online to find any product that could solve my problem… I never came across any such ready solution after reaching a few days.

However, I did come across some IoT (Internet of Things) automation concepts that some users programmed to operate sump valves.

At first, this concept seems very exciting to me…

Moreover, at that time, I was also very much involved in the concept of automation. 

I decided to do something with IoT automation to automate the sump valve.

I ordered all the different types of electrical components from China…

I received products. I Started implementing one concept after another concept to automate the sump tap.

It worked for only 2 or 3 months max, and electrical devices were failing due to Humidity inside the sump.

I tried multiple setups, but the result is still the same. It's failing due to Humidity inside the sump.

After experimenting for a few months, I understood this IoT concept was never going to work inside Sump, so I stopped experimenting with IoT stuff.

At any cost, I needed some solution to my problem… so I continued my research.

I asked Our plumbers, hardware shop owners & local waterman. All of them said there is no solution available to turn the tap on/off when water fills the sump where the sump tap is deep inside the sump.

While doing research, I got one Concept idea… That concept is ".................". 

This idea looks promising. So, I started implementing it, and it finally worked out for me.

Finally, I got a solid solution to the common problem. 

But…. ***this is not a ready-made solution.*** 

We need to do a little bit of manual work to make it work. This is a one-time task, and all the required materials will be available in a nearby shop.

Moreover, all the items required are commonly used items itself. Easy to buy… doesn't cost much. 

This is the **only solution perfect for automating the sump tap inside the sump without worrying about How deep your sump valve is located.**

I used this concept in my first building for more than 2 years without any issues… It works well. 

After implementing this new solution, I never bothered to operate my sump tap on or off. 

This new sump tap automation concept takes care of everything by itself. It turns off the tap only when it fills the full sump and Turns the tap back On when the water level gets low.

Finally, I discovered (hopefully, I have never seen anyone using this concept online) a solution to my problem, and I'm sharing that idea here so you can get back your time.
