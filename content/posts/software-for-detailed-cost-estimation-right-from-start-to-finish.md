Yesterday one of the subscriber asked me a questions:


**Dear Arun**

**Greetings of the day**  
**We are proposing to construct a G+ 5-story residential building at Shamshabad in Hyderabad. I need a detailed cost estimation right from Start to finish including Interiors and the external works. Could you suggest to me the software for the above-mentioned building or a similar building you have come across?**  

**Appreciate your valuable advice.**  

**Regards**

To my knowledge, common users cannot use software that provides such a detailed cost estimation. 

This software needs specialized knowledge to calculate the estimation accurately. Learning that skill just to calculate one or two house construction budgets is not worth spending our time on.

Let the professional engineer handle the job.  

The best and the right way to get the estimation is by getting in touch with the engineers who designed your building design. 

Yes, it cost money. It is one of the tasks that is worth spending.

Engineers usually estimate the construction cost accurately, considering the current market rate, which is very important.

Don't rely on any free cost estimator that you find online. 

Before starting your house construction, you need to estimate the budget properly to complete the project without stopping. 

Especially if you are on a tight budget. 

Always have 5 to 10% extra cash on the estimated budget. I have seen many users struggle with finishing because of improper budget planning.

And, sometimes, banks also don't help in such situations, depending on the case.

In such cases, owners are the ones who struggle with half-finished projects. 

You also need to keep one more thing in mind. You need more money at the ending stage of the construction than at the starting stage.

Keep that point while spending.

The cash you spend for the whole month during the construction stage, you will spend in a few hours during the finishing stage…

You will have to stop your construction work if you don't have enough cash reserve at the ending stage.

I have prepared an Excel sheet calculator for the construction cost estimator based on my real construction data. 

All you need to do is enter the building size in sq feet, and it will display the estimated budget you may need for your construction.

Keep in mind. 

This is just an estimated cost based on my construction expenses. So you shouldn't take the budget seriously. 

Still, it shows a rough budget category-wise, which could be useful for some users.

This calculator is a part of my Our House Construction Expenses Product.

I actually sold this Excel sheet for up to ₹99. 

But for the next 3 days (till the 23rd at 10PM), I'm going to give this for free to my email subscribers. 

If you are interested, just reply to this email saying "Send Me" and within 24hr I will send a link to download.
