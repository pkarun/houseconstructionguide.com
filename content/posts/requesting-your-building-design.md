Yesterday I got an email from this customer:

---------

Dear Mr. P K Arun,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Tarak Banerjee, and I am a fresher Civil Engineer. Recently, I came across your [incredibly detailed work on the Detailed House Construction Expenses with Product Price Details](https://houseconstructionguide.com/our-house-construction-expenses/). I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere appreciation for the effort you've put into tabulating every aspect of the expenses involved in constructing a G+3 building. Your meticulous attention to detail, right down to the smallest items, has been immensely helpful for someone like me who is new to the field of construction.

I am particularly impressed by how you have comprehensively listed hardware, electrical items, plumbing, painting, doors and windows, grills, toilets, kitchen and bedroom fittings, as well as all types of flooring and skirting in your Excel sheets, complete with quantities and rates. This document serves as a ready reference and real-world example for us in the construction industry.

Given your expertise in this area, I am keen to learn more from you. If possible, could you please share the structural and architectural drawings of the house you mentioned in your documentation? Studying these alongside your Excel data would greatly enhance my understanding and skills in this field.

Once again, thank you for your invaluable contribution to the construction community. I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.

Best regards,

Tarak Banerjee

Thanks for taking the time to write a detailed appreciation email. This kind of email really boosts my confidence in continuing my work.

**Given your expertise in this area, I am keen to learn more from you.** 

I can help as much as I can. Feel free to email me. 


**If possible, could you please share the structural and architectural drawings of the house you mentioned in your documentation? Studying these alongside your Excel data would greatly enhance my understanding and skills in this field.**

Yes. I can, and I have already shared that stuff on my blog. 

You can visit the below link to see structural diagram images: https://houseconstructionguide.com/building-design/

I cannot make it as a PDF file because the paper size is big, so I cannot scan it from a normal printer. So, I took images of the diagram and shared them on my blog.

It contains the Ground and First Floors. The second and third floors are similar to the Ground floor plan, so we didn't have a plan.

Regarding cost estimation on the blog you see, it is for the Ground and First Floor only. This is our first building Plan, which we constructed in 2017.  

Both Building plans are the same. 

Whatever the House Construction expenses excel sheet product data you have is our second building construction data that we recently constructed right next to the same first building.  

I hope it helps.

Arun
