Today, I saw our area waterman on the backside of my house going on his bike.

I called him to come and collect his monthly bribe…

He came and opened our sump cover to see our water level and collected ₹1000.

After collecting, he should leave. But this time, he asking ₹1,000 extra.

I was quite confused at first as to why he was asking ₹1000 extra.

When I asked why, He said, "Sir Ayudha Puja collection…"

People never stop asking for money when an opportunity arises.

After a little discussion, I paid ₹500, and he left.

Even our Bescom meter reader will come to collect the ayudha pooja fund.

When he came for this month's meter reading, he asked about the Ayudha pooja fund. While he was leaving our house, I spoke with 4 to 6 of our tenants (college students), so he left without asking.

My guess is he will come once again.

Last year, he came and collected with us.

You will also get such extra expenses when you are constructing your house.

I shared a tip at 3.10 in my Building Contractor Guide to prevent this type of unexpected expense.

Keep those tips in mind while speaking to contractors.

This type of extra expenses added up a little bit in your construction budget. Depending on the owner, they collect such funds.
