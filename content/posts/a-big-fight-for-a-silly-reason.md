This Saturday, a big fight happened backside of my house.

This is because a guy parked his car on the main road… almost no 4-wheelers can pass.

The time was around 11… or 11.30 pm, I guess.

Another car from the same place came. He started pressing the horn repeatedly.

After 10 minutes, the guy who had parked his car on the main road came. Both started talking.

Talking went to talking bad words.

Soon, the fight between the two guys started to severe.

At 12 am, rain also started.

I was watching this scene from my bedroom's backside window.

The scene looks exactly like a fight scene in a movie. Some neighbours came outside their house and started watching the scene.

To my surprise… none of them showed interest in stopping the fight. I felt a little bad seeing the situation.

The guy who parked the car on the road and that guy's family members were also not in their home at that moment.

His wife came outside and tried to control him but failed. Then she called his sister, who is staying on the same road.

His sister and her husband came running but could not manage the fight immediately.

After almost 1.30 hr fight, it was somewhat controlled.

This guy never parks vehicles like that. But his road was blocked due to the Ganesha festival, so he parked on the road itself.

Just for a small reason… some big fight happens.

Luckily, this guy's sister and her husband came and controlled the fight.

In house construction, most users face at least a few disputes during their construction time.

We had a big verbal fight with our electrical contractor in our first building.

In our second building, we had zero verbal fights.

The reason?

It could be a good time.

Or

We learned a lot of lessons in our first construction and never repeated any such mistakes in our second construction.

Multiple differences come between us and our contractors. However, all such differences have been handled successfully with the help of my house construction tracking system.

A tried and tested method to control any disputes between you and any contractor.
