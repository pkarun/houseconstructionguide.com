Once digging, you need to build size stone masonry work on all 4 corners of your site border.

In this step first it is filled with [size stone](https://houseconstructionguide.com/size-stone-price/) at the bottom. After that [Msnad](https://houseconstructionguide.com/buying-msand-jelly-like-a-pro/) and [Cement](https://houseconstructionguide.com/cement-expiry-date/) mixture is added on top of the size stones.

Once properly level is done, next on top of size stone masonry is built.
