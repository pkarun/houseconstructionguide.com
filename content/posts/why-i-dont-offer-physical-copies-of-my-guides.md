Yesterday, an HCG All-Access Pass buyer sent an email immediately after buying.

First email:

Sent from my iPhonei have paid 5000 kindly send me details

Within a few minutes:

If possible kindly send me hard copy to my address xx xxxxxxxx gardens pondicherry 605001
Sent from my iPhone

I replied to his second email.

99% of the chance, once anyone buys any of my products, they should immediately get an email containing product access details.

Looks like this user sent me an email without checking his email. He immediately realised he already received the details and is now requesting a physical copy of my product, if possible, in a proper way.

…
…

This is not the only customer requesting a physical copy of my product.

I do get a few such requests from some users. But I clearly say don't buy if you are going to consume my guides in physical copy.

The reason?

All my guides come with real images I have taken in my building or elsewhere.

And I cannot attach all those images in a PDF guide.

I could have done that if it were just one or two images. In my guide, I usually refer to multiple images for better understanding.

I cannot show all such high-quality images if I add them directly inside the PDF. So, I link to my Google Photos, where users can click, zoom in, and view multiple images on the concept I'm talking about.

This type of experience I cannot able to give in a Physical copy.

Not just that…

Sometimes, I even refer to YouTube videos in my guide to show them practical.

I cannot do all these things easily in a physical copy.

So, if anyone contacted me before buying for such requests, I would say not to buy directly.

If they don't know how to use a PC or Excel sheet or have a computer, I don't recommend any such user to buy my products.

Clear and straightforward.

If you are one of them, please don't buy my products. If not, go ahead.

PS: I attached some images to my upcoming Rental Property Guide today. I will add this guide to the members' area soon.
