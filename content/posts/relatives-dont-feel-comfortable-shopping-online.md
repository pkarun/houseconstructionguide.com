Today, my mom spoke with one of our relatives on the phone call. While they were speaking, I was also drinking coffee in the hall.

Our relative was telling her daughter was planning to buy a laptop.

Mom asked how much it cost… relative replied, "Around ₹50,000". Both their father and daughter planning to go to the city to bring a laptop.

My mom asked why in the city you can only buy online. Like she asked.

Relatives replied that, they are not comfortable shopping online.

They continued their conservation. After my coffee was over, I came back to write this email.

I understand why they are not feeling comfortable. Usually, they don't shop much online, so they are quite fearful of buying costly items online.

I have been shopping online for a decade. I have a very few bad experiences. I have never got soap or similar kinds of items yet…that you see and read online. 

But I accept online shopping is not for all. It requires some little skills to know the right sellers before buying expensive items.

My guess is, whatever the laptop they buy in offline shops. They will be paying a minimum ₹5000 to ₹15000 extra.

That too… now online sales are starting on 27th sep. 

If they shop online, they could easily save a lot of money.

If you also don't feel comfortable shopping online, try buying little less expensive items and get comfortable and save money and time.

In 99% of cases, nothing goes wrong.

Even if it happens, it's easier to fix, at least on Amazon.

Wait a few more days till the sales start and order all the required items on sale day to save more.

My brother and I arranged all ATMs and credit cards to save more with bank discounts.

This is the right time to order expensive items for a bigger discount.

Once the sale starts, I will be talking more about the products you could buy.

Oh… if your mobile is slow, it could be the right time to [easily exchange your old phone with a new one online.](https://www.amazon.in/s?k=mobile+exchange+offer&crid=17ZRFAQB67TSY&sprefix=mobile+exch%2Caps%2C250&linkCode=ll2&tag=newsite0003-21&linkId=efe45b5bad60a0e95c7959b10e4cfd97&language=en_IN&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)
