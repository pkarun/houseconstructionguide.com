Yesterday, we went to Shuka Vana, Mysore. A place where many parrot varieties can be found in a single place.

It has a Guinness World record for the most bird species in an aviary (a large enclosure for confining birds).

I was surprised to see so many types of parrots there. Some types of parrots are so big that I have never seen such big and colourful parrots live.

The environment was very cool, and I enjoyed it a lot.

Entry for seeing birds is free.

They have other things like the Bonsai garden and the Museum as well. These are chargeable. 50rs per person for an entry ticket for both the Garden and Museum.

Bonsai Garden didn't make any difference to me, but the Museum is worth more than the ticket price.

Unfortunately, we didn't have enough time to watch the Museum properly. So there is a little disappointment thereâ€¦

There are also a few luxurious temples inside.

It seems mostly like a commercial temple instead of a devotional place.

It's definitely worth visiting the place once or twice.

Initially, they sold bonsai garden tickets separately and museum tickets separately.

Now it's combined.

I think it's a good practice.

Some could see the value in the bonsai garden, and others could see the value in the Museum (like me). Instead of getting disappointed, now they feel Good.

At the end of the day, customers are happy, and they are also happy by selling Package tickets instead of separate tickets.

This is what my though process behind my All-Access Pass.

It's like sharing all my house construction knowledge in one place at one price. You may see value in one guide and not in another.

In the end, these guides are designed to help you avoid common mistakes while building your house and ultimately save money, time & regret.

If you want to enjoy the trip, I recommend All-Access Pass. Not buying the single guide.
