Yesterday, my brother and I were buying some products on Amazon.

Unlike previous year's deals, this year it was quite difficult to get deals.

The limit of how much you can buy from a single card and all such other rules.

I think in the past few days, I ordered more than 50,000 worth of products. Because of some limitations from Amazon, I had to use multiple Amazon accounts and different SBI cards to secure deals.

This never happened before. This is the first time I felt like that.

While shopping, I noticed a few things…

Few sellers reduced the price, and few increased the price.

It's your job to [find the right products that reduced the price to get maximum benefit](https://ashout.com/amazon-price-tracker-india/) from the deal.

Flipkart already ended its sale.

Only Amazon's big billion-day sale is running…

Before buying online, I enquired about a few offline shops for product quotations. They always quoted more than what I got from online.

Not just a little bit more…

If you have any items you plan to shop, this is the right time to get a good discount and save money.

These are the some [product category I recommend to shop online](https://houseconstructionguide.com/products-i-recommend-buying-online/). I bought #1, #3 and a few other products in this deal.

Act quickly to save more.

If you are still constructing your house, wait till next year's deals.
