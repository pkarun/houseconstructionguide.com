When we were constructing our second house, I went to a nearby hardware shop to buy some items. 

There, a new lady homeowner came to purchase some items.

During billing time, that lady asked the shop owner for an alternative solution for the float valve. As it stops water before filling the sump.

She was explaining the same issue that I was facing. Her sump tap is installed somewhat down inside the sump, and the standard float valve does not allow the tap to fill the water.

The shop owner listened to her problem and confidently answered there was *no solution to such a problem*.

I was standing right next to her, simply listening and laughing internally for the shop owner's answer. I have already implemented the solution for that problem and have enjoyed it for a few yearsâ€¦.

There are many such homeowners currently suffering from such an issue who have no clue about the solution they could try to fix such a problem.

There is a simple solution that anyone can implement in their sump from readily available items from the market. 

All they need to do is do a little manual work to make it work.

There is no ready solution available yet. But if you are ready to do a little manual work one time, there is a super solution that fixes the standard float valve problem.

I don't know how many of them avoid using the float valve because of this problem and still operate the sump tap/valve manually. 

If you are facing such a problem in your house, then [I have a solution you must try in your house](https://houseconstructionguide.com/sump-valve-automation/).

This solution can be easily implemented without plumbers, even if your house construction work is over.
