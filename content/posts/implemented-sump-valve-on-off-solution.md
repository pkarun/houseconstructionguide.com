Yesterday was Saturday, so my brother was staying at our house. So, I planned to implement my Sump automation to stop water automatically once the sump is full.

This is the same as what float valves do, but no height limit exists. 

That meansâ€¦ no matter where your Tap located inside the sump, it can perform On/Off of tap based on the water level you set.

The same concept has been implemented in my first building but not in the second buildingâ€¦ now recently our water man leaving too much water so we need to On and Off tap many times a week.

To avoid this boring and repetitive task, I now implemented it in our second building. 

I haven't thought of sharing this guide till now because I need to bring materials from the shop. Now, the time has come. 

I need to implement it for my sump. 

I took photos and videos to write a guide on this topic. 

I will soon start working on this sump automation guide as well.

If you need to automate the Tap On/Off function and the float valve cannot do it because the tap is down inside the sump, you are for a treat.

My upcoming guide will solve this problem. 

I still remember spending almost 1 week trying to find a solution to this problem and implementing it in our first sump. Somehow, I discovered this unique idea to make it work.

This is my own idea (At least to my knowledge). 

This requires some little manual work as well. There is no ready-made product available on the market to fulfil this task. 

Don't worry; this is going to be small workâ€¦. it's easy. 

If you need to implement this in your sump, then you need to wait some more days. 

Once I finish writing, I will add it [inside the members' area](https://houseconstructionguide.com/products/#all-access-pass). 

This will definitely be a useful idea, and you will love it. 

That's all I wanted to share today.

I'm quite excited to share this idea. ðŸ™‚
