Yesterday, while going through my email inbox, I came across an email with the subject line "Pain".

I remembered one incident in our first building when I saw the word pain.

It happened when all the construction work was over, and we shifted from a rental property to a brand-new house.

Usually, once the housewarming function is over, it's recommended that someone stay in the brand-new house.

That's a kind of tradition we follow. I'm not sure about others…

So, we started shifting all the items on the same day, and I also helped with the shifting process.

I stand on the staircase, and when someone gives me an item from below me, I take and pass that item to the next person.

While doing this type of shifting, I noticed no pain that time…

Once all the shifting was done, whenever I walked for a longer period or in any hilly area, I started noticing some strange pain in one leg.

That pain still has not left me.

When I put more strain on my legs, I feel that pain again, or else I won't notice that pain at all…

After thinking about why and how it happened, I noticed it happened only after shifting from rental property to our house.

That day, it seemed I put more stress on one of my legs than it could handle.

Whatever weight I used to lift while standing on the staircase put a load on that one leg.

Don't make similar mistakes to what I did on that day.

Use labourers to shift the materials and monitor them on both buildings at shifting times.

You spend a little on labour charges, but you take care of your health. Which is way more important than anything else.
