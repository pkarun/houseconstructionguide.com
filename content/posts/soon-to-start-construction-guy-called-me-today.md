Today at around 6 PM, I got a call from one guy… 

Who got my number from the Facebook ads I run to sell my products. 

I usually get calls about product queries, doubts, etc. I always answer such calls. 

Even for low-priced products. 

When I picked up this guy's call, he asked he needed some help from me…

I asked what type of help Sir...

He replied I'm planning to construct my house soon. I need your input, and I need you to share your experience.

Oh.. That I already did. 

I wrote about all kinds of my house construction experience, and I'm still writing about all such experiences inside my guides. 

I informed you can buy all my guides for just ₹3000.

Meanwhile, I also shared a few of my real stories about construction. He already had one such experience in his building plan approval.

He continued asking some of his ideas and doubts, and he asked a few insider questions. 

I answered his questions… and the reason why.

This guy was impressed when I shared some tips and ideas in a 6-minute call.

He requested that I meet with him physically to ask for some guidance on house construction.

I told him clearly I don't do that for free of cost, sir, for sharing my experience. You can buy my guide at 3,000 rs like I told…

But it looks like this guy may not be computer-savvy, I don't know. He said he is ready to pay more than my digital guide price, but I need to answer his questions face to face.

I agreed to his request.

He said I would list all the questions and meet you at any suggested place.

I said fine. 

Once you are ready, do let me know. I will update the location, and we can meet as I informed him.

He said ok, replied thanks, and disconnected the call.

This guy's construction budget is around 75L.

He already had some bad experiences in plan approval, so he just spoke to me directly and learned what I was sharing was already experienced. 

I suggest you speak with some experienced house owner who finished house construction recently and learn from their mistakes.

Because making mistakes in house construction gets costly. This guy learned already, so he is ready to spend money to avoid such mistakes again.

Based on a 6-minute talk, he understood what I shared was valuable and was ready to pay me more for personalized feedback.

I never offered physical meetings or giving 1 to 1 personalized feedback (for just 1 day) before. This guy requested and was ready to pay more… so I said yes. 

Speaking directly is a different feeling than just sharing digital products.

If yours is the first building, speak to other homeowner and learn from their mistakes. [I shared my experience with my guides if you need to learn from my mistakes](https://houseconstructionguide.com/products/).
