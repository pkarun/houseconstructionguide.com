We were looking for Jali wood diwan cots. In sawmills, they were saying they don't have jali wood.

After asking our carpenter, he suggested a shop where they use only Jali wood to make cots.

My dad wants to have cots with only jali wood because of the hardness of the wood, quality and cost.

We visited the shop once, enquired about pricing, and came back.

Today, my Dad and I went to order a bulk diwan cot for our rental property.

While negotiating the price, the seller quoted ₹3800 for the specification we requested.

We told ₹3400.

He said ok…

Because of the lessons we learned during our house construction time, we took one book to make it in writing.

We wrote 3400*16 on the book to calculate the 1st phase order cost.

The seller also saw the price as soon as we wrote the cost. And immediately informed us it was 3600rs.

No..we told ₹3400. "No sir, you told ₹3600", the seller said.

This conversation went on for some time. It happened because of the sound seller probably couldn't hear the price clearly and misheard what we said.

Luckily, we decided to put it in writing before placing the order. Otherwise, while doing the settlement, a problem could have been created.

That's why I always tell you how important it is to have everything in writing or with proper proof.

When you are doing your house construction, you will be doing a lot of transactions. Having proper proof is highly recommended for all the transactions you do.

After learning some hard lessons in my first construction, we changed many things in the second construction to avoid disputes with contractors.

Luckily, my new system, whatever I adopted, helped in many cases.

I recommend every new house construction user follow what I shared inside my house construction tracking system to avoid the difference between you and contractors.

In that guide, I shared some of my case studies and how they helped me in problematic situations. So you will understand the importance of that guide.

Small changes in the system we follow can avoid many disputes.
