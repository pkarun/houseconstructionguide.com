I already [hired a private guy](https://houseconstructionguide.com/my-new-ac-installation-circus/) to do my AC installation setup who understood the importance of the AC Vacuuming process, even at a higher cost than what I would give for a company installation guy.

Installation was scheduled on Saturday with a private party.

Meanwhile, I also raised a complaint with Panasonic regarding the technician. They also shared a direct contractor guy's contact number to speak with him this time.

When I spoke at first, he shared that it's not required for a new AC. After that, I requested him in a nice manner to at least do for my AC. Even I openly told them I could pay extra as well if required.

To that, he kept quiet.

After some days, he sent another technician with the Vaccum tool. They did vacuuming a little carelessly… still, something is better than nothing.

So, my AC installation was over as per my plan from the company side itself.

They charged me 500 rs extra for the vacuuming process, which they were supposed to do themselves at the original charge.

I'm fine with it.

At least they listened to my word and did as per my request.

They told me they don't perform AC Vacuuming by default while installing.

This happens because most owners don't know. Some owners didn't do anything, even if they knew about it. Because convincing technicians is not easy….

You can see it on YouTube.

Many of the owners/YouTubers are aware that they need to do proper AC vacuuming before installation. But when the technician comes, they don't act on it.

I simply didn't allow them to install at first. I spoke to the contractor in a good way. I requested to make an exception for me and raised multiple complaints on Panasonic.

Finally, the Panasonic technician bought the vacuum and performed the cleaning.

Speaking to the technician contractor in a good way is what helped me get it done, not because of the complaints given to the Panasonic team.

During my AC installation, I learned some lessons. I'm going to share all those lessons in my next product. Which is going to be helpful for future house construction users.

After the installation was over from the company, I called and asked the private party to cancel my scheduled AC installation. They happily agreed to it.

This email is being written under the new AC with a comfortable temperature inside my home office.
