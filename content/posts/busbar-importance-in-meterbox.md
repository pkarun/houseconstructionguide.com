When we were staying at the rental property, one incident happened. I explain that real incident so you can understand one useful benefit of having a Busbar in the meter box.

I have my own online business. I was not going anywhere for job. I was just working from my home with my PC and internet connection.

Everything went smoothly until one day, my computer UPS started beeping.

Power is there. UPS still keeps beepingâ€¦

Every day, UPS beeping started happening multiple times.

This issue continued for several days. We noticed low voltage when we checked.

This started to bother me a lot to me. I could not even continue working because UPS always started beeping.

So we complained to the house owner regarding this issue.

They called an electrician, and he also noticed the same. The low voltage issue.

This electrician changed the house load phase to another phase in the meterbox bus bar to fix the low voltage issue.

The Low voltage issue was gone in 20 minutes.

This couldn't have been possible if the house had no bus bar in the meter box.

To bring all 3 Phases from the main pole to the meter box, you need a Busbar.

Suppose you use a Busbar in the meter box. In that case, electricians bring all 3 Phases (Red, Yellow, Blue) and a Neutral (Black) when bringing the main power line to the meter box.

If you don't use a Busbar in the meter box, electricians, bring anyone Phase and Neutral from the main line. That's it. He doesn't bring all Phases.

If the busbar was not there, then to fix the issue, the electrician could need to change the cable on the main electric pole to a different phase, which is not easy.

*Isn't it an advantage to have a Busbar?*

Usually, if you use power for a single house, you don't need a busbar. 

Having a busbar for the single house is an added feature and not a must-have feature.

If you are using Borewell in your house, then you need Busbar. Because the borewell requires 3-phase power.

I hope this incident helps you understand the importance of having a Busbar in the meterbox.

In my Electrical Work Guide, I shared a few best practices you need to follow to take the connection from the Main Line to Your Meterbox with Images.

Even our meter reader appreciated our Meterbox setup.

Most electrical contractors skip most of the steps to avoid work. 

House owners don't understand; contractors just need your money. So they do what is easier for them, not what's best practice.

I shared the best and recommended meter box setup with images inside my Electrical Work Guide.
