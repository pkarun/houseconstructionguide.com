The next step is filling the concrete in the excavated trenches.

Usually, your building contractor informs the Gang Team to do this work. At the same time, 1 mason and a few of his labourers are present on the footing concreting time.

This is to ensure Pillars are straight while pouring concrete into the trench. After concrete dries, they cannot make changes.

They check the pillar level with a level-checking tool and make pillar adjustments if necessary.
