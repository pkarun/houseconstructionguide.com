A guy I follow on Twitter today tweeted that the product was missing from the box he ordered from Amazon.

The product cost 45K. But still, the guy seemed very cool and raised a support ticket with Amazon regarding this issue.

I believe within one week, they usually finish their investigation and inform the result to the buyer of the status of the complaint.

Once, I also had a similar experience.

In my case, the product is missing instead of items inside the box.

Both are different cases.

Mine is easy to solve for them.

I believe I ordered a CCTV system from Amazon during a similar sale event. In that order, one camera was missing.

When I noticed the missing item, I didn't get much tension like most users doâ€¦

I know about Amazon.

I simply made a complaint with the Amazon support team on their website. They promised within 7 days, they would share an update about the complaint.

After the investigation, they updated me, and the case was solved in my favour.

They asked if I needed the product or if I should get a refund for that product.

As I ordered on the product on sale day, I got a discount, so I requested the product.

They sent me the missing product.

I believe the same thing will happen to the above guy.

I order almost all products online. This is the first product which came missing in my case.

In extremely rare cases, mistakes happen. If you are not bothered by such things, then online shopping is something I recommend everyone to try.

You save a lot online instead of offline shopping.

From yesterday onwards, I've been tired of attending delivery calls back to back.

Now, the home theatre installation service guy just calling me.

I'm going to watch the product demo now. Which was also bought online during this sale.

Bye for now
