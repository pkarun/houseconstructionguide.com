Once [PCC bedding is done](https://houseconstructionguide.com/pcc-bed-for-footing/), the next step is installing Reinforced Mat Laying and Column/Pillar standing.

The Barbender team will come and prepare those steel mats.

While preparing those Mats and pillars, your building contractor will mark the pillar's exact location with the help of thread as per the engineer's plan.

First, your building contractor will tie thread all over the site wherever the pillars come. After properly positioning the thread where the pillar comes, he will put some [cement](https://houseconstructionguide.com/cement-suppliers-price-compared/) and [Msand](https://houseconstructionguide.com/buying-msand-jelly-like-a-pro/) mixture to mark the pillar's exact location.

In the below images, those markings are covered by [empty cement bags](https://houseconstructionguide.com/why-you-shouldnt-sell-empty-cement-bag/) due to rain.

Before placing the pillars, they removed the cement cover and place it where the marking was done.
