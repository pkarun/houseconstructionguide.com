A few days back, I watched a YouTube video and found an interior designer video.

In that video, one interior designer shares why chajja is not required in homes. I'm talking about the chajja that comes inside the room.

Every new house these days comes with a wall drop. 

Most woodwork guys, building contractors, and interior designers suggest not doing room chajja.

If you have a wall drop, room chajja is usually not required. 

That's why all/most contractors suggest don't do it.

Even in our construction, everyone suggested something like that. But we decided to go with concrete chajja itselfâ€¦

The only reason is that with concrete chajja, load-bearing capacity is greater, and we don't want to take a chance with a wooden board.

Doing concrete chajja increases the cost a little bit. But it's definitely worth it.

Currently, we keep some heavy items in one wall drop. I don't think we could have kept them confident if we only did wooden boxes.

The choice is yours.

Doing concrete chajja doesn't affect any look as Plywood properly covers them when walldrops are done.

Suppose you didn't do any concrete chajja. In that case, it will help woodworkers/walldrop installers to finish their job faster & more easily.

Builder contractors save on labourer costs.

You save a little bit of money on labour and material costs.

Going with concrete chajja, you can keep anything without worrying about weight.  

The choice is yours. 

We went with concrete chajja everywhere in both buildings and never regretted the choice until today.
