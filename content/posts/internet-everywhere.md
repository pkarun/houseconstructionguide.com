The right way to take the Internet to every corner of your house so that all your devices are connected to wifi and experience better Internet speed.

When we built our house, the one thing I was very much focused on was… Having an internet connection in every corner of our house. 

The reason is, My business is Internet Marketing. 

This means - for me to work, I need to have Internet everywhere. So I'm focused on implementing internet/wifi everywhere in our building. 

Whether I stay inside or on the terrace, I planned to get the Internet instantly if I need it. 

Initially, I planned to have Internet only for my work and convenience. 

But nowadays, I realize what a good decision I took to implement Internet at all locations in our building. 

Because these days, any modern device you take supports wifi. You will lose any features the device supports if you don't have a proper wifi signal. 

I personally got one such device, which is -- robotic vacuum cleaner. 

For this device to work at its full potential, it needs to have connected to wifi wherever it goes. If it's not connected, you will lose many of its functions.

So ensuring wifi signals are available everywhere in your building is very much necessary these days if you want to enjoy modern tech devices. 

In this Internet Everywhere mini-guide, I will explain how you can implement Internet to all the locations in your house by taking only one Internet connection from any Internet service provider (Act Fibernet, Excitel, etc.). 

Yes. 

You only need one internet service provider to have Internet service everywhere in your home.

### Don't use the Internet like this

Most of the users what they do is, they take internet service from some ISP (Internet Service Provider) and have one wifi router and connect all the devices to only one wifi/router. 

It's ok if they get a good wifi signal. 

But in most cases, they simply manage with one or two available wifi signals in their device. And because of the low wifi signal, you cannot enjoy full-speed Internet. 

It's a waste of your Internet subscription charge that you are paying every month to your ISP if you cannot fully enjoy the Internet to the full extent. 

And… 

Many of them use only one wifi router because they don't even understand how to set up multiple routers with single Internet or they don't have the setup ready to implement multiple wifi routers in their home. 

For whatever reason… they are stuck with one or two wifi signals, and because of this, they use a buggy internet service in their house. 

To avoid all such issues… I have written this mini guide about having Internet all over your building. How to plan, implement, what are all the tools you need, things you need to take care of, etc., are mentioned in this mini guide. 

I recommend that everyone implement this guide in their new building, even if you are not an internet user. Because if you need it in the future, you cannot implement that time the way you do it now.

### Common Myths about Internet/wifi

**1) You can have only one wifi Name** 

No, that's wrong.   
  
With only one internet connection, you have multiple wifi names. All you need to do is, you need to add multiple routers to the network to have more wifi names. To do such a setup, you need to know some networking knowledge. 

**2) You cannot have multiple wifi Router** 

No. You can have multiple wifi routers with a single internet connection.

**3) You need multiple internet connections for each router/wifi name** 

No. That's wrong.  

You can have multiple routers or wifi names with only one internet connection. 

**4) It will cost too much to offer Internet in other rooms** 

Wrong. It doesn't cost much. The cost is only a one-time setup cost. That's it.
