When you are ready to start your construction work, the electrical contractor is one of the few contractors you need to finalize before or as soon as you start your construction work.

The reason is that you should apply for a Temporary connection through the Electrical Contractor itself.

If you are ready to Pick your electrical contractor, I recommend that everyone go through this guide before you finalize your Electrical contractor.

For any new users… I always recommend is, make sure to choose the Right Contractor.

If you choose the right contractor, most of your house construction problems can be solved easily.

But if you choose one wrong contractor, you will have issues until you stop dealing with that contractor.

That's what happened to us when we were constructing our First Building.

We choose the Wrong Electrical Contractor… and pay the fine with Money, verbal fights, headache, and unfinished work.

We learned good lessons with that contractor and made a proper adjustment in choosing the electrical contractors in the second building.

And for the second building, we Got an AWESOME Electrical Contractor.

You may think it could be our LUCK.

Maybe… maybe not.

We simply followed many steps for the second building before we finalized our contractor.

I'm going to share everything you need to know about how to pick the right electrical contractor what are all the things you need to know before finalizing your contractor.

Initially, this guide is written only for picking the right Electrical Contractor. But later, I added some tips you need to know while doing electrical work for your building.

It took me 20+ pages of content to explain everything you need to know about electrical work for your building.

And it's not a big book.

Like any of my other courses… It's a mini-course that can be completed in one sitting.

In this guide, I'm not explaining any technical terms related to electrical… these are general tips. I recommend everyone to know before doing electrical work in their building.

I cannot explain all those 40+ electrical tips here on this sale page.

These are real genuine tips.

These are the lessons I learned by wasting my money, me facing issues in our building, discovering them, and noticing in other buildings.

By just reading this mini guide/course, I'm sure you will save money, avoid having issues with your contractor, future-proof your house, know how few small changes can make your life easier for the life span of the building, and more.

Really… I believe if you just take and implement the few ideas I gave in this guide, you will get your money back by many folds.

My Dad is an Electrical Engineer, and I told him to review this guide once.

After reading this guide in one sitting… I asked How's the guide?

He replied - GOOD. But there are some grammar mistakes are there.

See… I won't tell you this guide has high English standards and well-polished grammar.

Please don't expect those.

I'm not an English grammar teacher.

I asked him how much you rate this guide… he said 10/10.

I felt really happy getting such a response from him.

Really.

That doesn't mean you also feel the same.

But all I can guarantee is I put my best effort into making this guide to help other first-time house construction owners. That's it.
