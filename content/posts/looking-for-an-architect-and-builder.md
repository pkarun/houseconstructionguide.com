A few days back, one of our customers sent the below email.

Hi Arun,

I am looking for an architect and builder for construction on my plot.

Can you refer/suggest some good builders and architects for the same ?

Can you also let me know what is the current rate for the builder contractor with material and without material ?

Thanks

**Can you refer/suggest some good builders and architects for the same ?**

I could. But the problem is that if your plot is more than 10km from my builder's house, he won't take the project.

Our builder prefers only sites that are near his physical location.

If your location is near chikkabanavara, let me know so I can share his contact details.

Regarding the Architect, you can get my engineer's office address here:

I also recommend hiring a nearby engineer to help with the site visit.

**Can you also let me know what is the current rate for the builder contractor with material and without material ?**

[I don't recommend the material contract](https://houseconstructionguide.com/our-relative-material-contract-story/) and don't have any idea.

Coming to the Labour contract:

Regarding the current rate, I don't know the latest rates. I recommend you speak to a nearby house construction owner or contact a few building contractors you have to get to know the market price.

If I'm not wrong, 1 chadura = ₹31,000/- should be running.

If you want to know what we paid for our two buildings, then visit the article below to know about it.

If you have some time, I recommend waiting until I release my Building contractor guide.

In this guide, I will share a few things you need to know to help structure a good contract with your building contractor, which could also save money.
