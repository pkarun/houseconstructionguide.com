Planning to do a Gas cylinder chamber outside your house? Then here is a cool concept yesterday I came across:

If you are going to implement that design idea in your house, make sure to use heavier & more hinges to sustain cylinder weight.

I’m personally not a fan of keeping cylinders outside the house. 

I didn’t implement a cylinder chamber outside the house in our second building for the same reason.

Few things you should keep in mind before implementing any type of cylinder chamber outside the house.

- it’s expensive to do gas piping. If you have one or two houses, no issue. Multiple houses? Then it’s not a good idea.

- If your building has multiple houses and doesn’t already have a [Gas metering facility](https://houseconstructionguide.com/gas-pipeline-work-required-or-not/) in your area, don’t implement this gas piping concept. It gets costly and not worth it. 

- Safety things should also be kept in mind.

- too much space wastage if you offer such cylinder compartments on the ground floor. If you only have a few houses, then it's ok

After seeing both pros and cons in our first building, I skipped implementing a gas chamber on the ground floor.
