Yesterday, my dad and my daughter went to his friend's house, which is the backside of our house. 

It is a casual visit. My dad often visits them to spend their free time. 

During their visit, Dad's friend tried calling the water tanker guy from their phone. That time, my dad enquired why the water tanker...

They said no water was there in the sump.

To which he asked when onwards you are taking tanker water?

They replied that it had been almost 1 month, and we were using tanker water in our house.

Their house is on the main road. 

Our house is on the internal road. 

Anytime a waterman wants to leave any neighbouring area, water has to go past their house. So they should always have water in their sump.

In our case, we only get water when the watermen leave the water in our specific area.

Moreover, in their house, they only have 2 rental properties and their own house. A total of 3 houses are managed in their building.

In our case, we have 8 rental properties and our own house. So, there is a total of 9 houses in one building. 

In each building, we have 9 houses. 

We still haven't used tanker water.

Yes, we do have a borewell. Still, we haven't used a borewell to fill the sump.

We easily manage water with municipal water supply in our building...

But all the neighbouring houses have already using tanker water for the past 1 month...

A similar incident happened a few days back when my dad and daughter went for a walk.

When the Tanker vehicle was filling their sump, the house owner asked my dad how we manage water in our building.

Because our building is kind of a highlight in our area. So they casually asked whether we were getting sufficient water to manage in our building.

My dad simply replied-- we use borewell water when a shortage happens. To avoid unnecessary attention from the public. 

In practice, we haven't used our borewell water. Both our buildings have been managed with municipal water till now.

How is it possible?

Proper Calculation.

At the time of our house construction, we were clearly aware of the water problem in Bangalore, and we planned very well so we didn't face water scarcity.

Plus... 

There are multiple other points we keep in mind.

In this case, I credit a calculator I used during our sump construction.

In my sump construction guide, I shared all the things you need to keep in mind while constructing your sump. Also, I shared a calculator I recommend using during your sump construction time so you don't face such water scarcity often.
