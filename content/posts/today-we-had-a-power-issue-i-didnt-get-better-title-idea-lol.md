Today, while I was working in my home office, at around 4 PM, the light suddenly started dimming.

Without giving much attention, I continued my work.

Within a few minutes, my PC monitor also got turned off.

That time, I understood something was seriously wrong.

I immediately turned off my PC directly to prevent any further damage and went to our first house to ask my Dad what went wrong.

My dad is an electrical engineer, so he went directly to the second building meter box. And started checking Voltage in all phases.

That time, he told me in one phase, power was having some issues from the BESCOM. (I guess it is a single Phase, he told)

I asked if we needed to turn off the main power?

He replied, It's better if we can.

But as he didn't tell seriously, I didn't turn off Mains.

If I turned it off, I again needed to go to turn ON.

So, I just informed all my tenants on our WhatsApp group to not use any important electrical appliances.

A few months before, we had a similar incident; the Neutral Wire got cut on the main pole. Within a few minutes, 3 chargers of our tenants were gone.

That time, my Dad immediately turned off the Main supply (ours has a different setup to turn off Mains) without thinking, or else even more damage could have happened.

When you order a meter box, you need to properly plan.

Just don't listen to your electrical contractor. He always tells me what's easier/standard for him to do the work. Not what's best for you.

When the meter reader first came to take our meter reading, he praised the meter box setup. (credits goes to my dad)

In my electrical work guide, I shared a [meter box setup best pratice](https://houseconstructionguide.com/electrical-work-guide/) so you could follow a much better setup than others.

A properly planned meter box helps during maintenance or when any issues happen.
