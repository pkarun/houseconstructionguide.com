All my family members attended our relative's wedding here in Bangalore today.

Even though I was supposed to go, due to the seat limit in the car, I stayed at home.

If I had taken our car, I also could have gone… but I usually avoid driving in Bangalore traffic for new places. I'm a kind of safe guy who always likes to play safe games.

So I sent all our family members on Ola cab.

While booking an Ola cab, I noticed today that the trip's price varies every minute.

Like 200rs to 800rs! For the same car, same trip. Never saw this happening before.

This is the first time I saw this in an Ola cab.

To get a lower price, Go back and search the destination again. Sometimes, the price will go back within a few minutes.

This is something I learned today. Maybe this could help someone who uses Ola cabs.

One more incident that happened today in the marriage is… Morning breakfast was over before 60+ people had their breakfast.

People were shouting because breakfast was over.

The cook they booked is the same cook who did it at our housewarming function.

Here, he executed the function successfully. But there… Food over before all get a chance to have.

My dad told me some heated arguments also happened there.

Based on our suggestion, they only went with this cook. But our relative did one thing wrong.

They ordered food like a material contract.

They told, morning XX no of plates. Afternoon XX no of plates. All materials are from cook.

They did this to save their time and energy to bring ration.

This is completely WRONG.

As soon as I learned they went with the material contract, I told them they made a mistake.

In marriage, there is a shortage of breakfast food in the morning.

The reason? Cook did only whatever they ordered. Not more, Not less.

After ordered quantity was over, the food was over.

It's not a cook mistake. It's the owner's mistake. Our relative also got to know but couldn't do anything.

Afternoon, they didn't make the same mistake.

Keep in mind that doing any kind of function is not easy.

I shared some personal lessons about doing our Housewarming function [inside my guide](https://houseconstructionguide.com/housewarming-function/).
