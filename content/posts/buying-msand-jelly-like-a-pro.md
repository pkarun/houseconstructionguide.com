Buying Msand and Jelly becomes a big headache and time-consuming process when you start your house construction.

While building our first building, we also made the same mistake and bought the material incorrectly.

It was a time-consuming and painful process we were following…

But when we started our second building, we learned a lot of things. We started following another method, which is much better, not time-consuming and not painful to follow.

In this guide, I will share what we were doing in the first building and what we did in the second building to buy Msand and Jelly.
