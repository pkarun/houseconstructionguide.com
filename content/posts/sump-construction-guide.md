In this Sump construction guide, I will share things you need to remember while building your Sump.

If you are a first-time building the Sump, this guide will help properly point out all those important points you need to remember.

When we built our first Sump, we made some mistakes—at the time of building, no one guided us about those important points.

Day by day, we slowly started noticing our mistake on our Sump.

If you don't want to make such mistakes, this sump construction guide will help.

Can you fix those mistakes now?

Nope… not possible.

This guide is from our personal experience, who made a mistake in the first Sump and fixed such issues in the next Sump. I will share all those things in this guide.

Not only that…

If you have Borewell in your house, I shared some tips and things you must remember about Borewell.
