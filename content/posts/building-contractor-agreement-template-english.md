After the long festival break, I worked on creating products for my customers.

A few days back, I got a few customers requesting a Building Contractor Agreement Template. I avoided creating a template for quite a few days.

After noticing many of my buyers asking the same questions, I decided to sit and do the work for them.

For the past 2 days, I have sat and prepared this Building Contractor Agreement Template.

This is not some random template that you see anywhere else. This is the agreement that I created, putting all my knowledge and experience into it.

Whatever the tips and suggestions I shared in my building contractor guide, I implemented them in this agreement.

This is quite a detailed agreement.

It contains 8 pages of detailed instructions by keeping Owner Favor.

That doesn't mean I ignored the Building Contractor's point of view. I take care of them as well.

It's a balance between the owner and contractor type of agreement. However, the agreement mostly favours the owners' safety more than the contractor.

Not just that.

This agreement is written in simple English, making it easy to understand and make changes. Moreover, instead of creating a big paragraph of type of text, I created a point-wise. Hence, it's easier to modify according to your requirements.

If you need to customise anything, it's very easy to edit.

I'm providing the Word Document. You can download it to your PC and modify the agreement as required.

I highlighted a few places in the agreement. You need to look at those places and make changes to meet your needs.

This agreement comes in the English language. I created two popular versions of the payment structure agreement and will offer both versions for you to play with.

I'm offering this agreement template inside my Building Contractor Guide in the 2.4 section. If you have access to the building contractor guide, please download the latest version of the guide to see the download link.

If you don't have access, you get it by buying the Building Contractor Guide here:

I still have not updated the Agreement template on the above sales page, but you will get access inside the guide.
