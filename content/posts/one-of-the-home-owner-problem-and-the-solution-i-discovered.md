Staying in rental property is one type of problem…

Having our own house and managing it properly is another type of problem…

This is what I noticed after we entered our first house. 

Out of all the homeowner's problems, one problem that fell under my responsibility was operating the sump valve weekly.

The float valve is a perfect solution to automate… In our case, our tap is located a little deep inside the sump. 

So, if we install the standard float valve to automate my sump valve, the float valve won't allow us to fill our sump fully… 

In our case, it's almost 10 to 15 thousand litres of water storage capacity. So it's a waste of a lot of water storage space.

I decided to take this problem personally to solve it because I need to always operate this sump valve.

After spending almost a few days researching, I found a cool and simple solution that solves this problem.

Out of curiosity, I implemented it on my sump… Wow. It worked perfectly fine. 

I almost forgot about operating the sump valve after implementing this new idea. No more worries about sump overflow or opening the sump tap again without forgetting.

Everything is now taken care of by this automation one.

Moreover, it doesn't cost much to implement.

With all the regular items available from nearby stores, you can easily implement the concept that I have shared. 

Recently, I implemented the same automation concept in my second house, so I took photos of the products and wrote this guide now… 

It cost less than ₹500 to implement in my second house. 

Suppose your tap is a little down, and you are avoiding a float valve because it won't allow it to completely fill your sump. In that case, this is a perfect solution you should implement in your house.

It saves a hell lot of time.

It's absolutely worth it to implement in your house. 

By the way, if you are in the construction field, knowing this knowledge would help solve your customer's problems.

You could charge a consultation fee for giving such ideas… (I would happily pay for solving such a painful problem).

My wife's parents are coming home today, so I am writing this email in the afternoon itself. 

In the evening, I will be busy spending time with them talking.

If you got any questions feel free to reply to any of my email I will respond.
