Do you want to know one of the easiest ways to lose a few days of hard work and lakhs of rupees during House Construction time? Then read on...

My parents and my wife went to our relative's engagement on Friday. They went to Bus. On the way, my dad noticed one building's ground floor RCC and the wall was bent. 

He told RCC that it was almost touching the ground because it was that much bend...

I asked did you take a Photo?

He replied, "No, How can I take a Photo on a moving bus."

Ya ok...

I ask what could have caused it to happen like that. My dad didn't know the real reason. On a guess estimate, a few failures could have happened. 

1) Was the pillar and beam not there? 
2) Centring Issue

For reason one, he didn't properly notice the pillar and beam in the building. As the bus was moving... This could be one of the reasons for such an issue. 

For the 2nd point, Centring Issue. He also thought about this guess for the ground floor RCC failure.

The site size is around 30*40...

Because of groundfloor RCC failure, the building owner lost all the wall constructions and a few lakhs of rupees that he spent on labour, materials, and RCC. 

All are complete waste.

Now, they need to demolish the whole ground floor building and start the reconstruction again.

Whatever the owner kept the budget for the building, he lost a full one-floor budget because of his or the labourer's small mistakes.

However, we don't know the exact reason for this and what could have happened in the building. We both suspected that it could be because of the **Centring mistake**.

Because failure happened on the ground floor...

Which is where most Centring failure happens. 

A similar kind of incident happened in our second building as well... 

Thankfully, my DAD noticed some weird behaviour and immediately acted to prevent centring failure.

If, on the moulding day, my dad was not there and didn't know to act immediately on the spot, a similar kind of disaster could have also happened in our building as well.

Even to this day, I remember that incident.

Apart from a few YouTube videos, I have never seen any live RCC failure.

When the same thing is supposed to happen to our building, it is simply undigestable stuff...

Our centring guys were there, and the building contractors were there. They simply didn't have the proper knowledge to act to fix the issue.

They were using human power to fix the problem at the critical stage, which is not enough.

After using my dad's skills, the problem was fixed.

I shared the whole incident, the precautions you need to take during ground floor RCC and the steps we took to fix the issue are all shared inside my [During Molding Time](https://houseconstructionguide.com/during-molding-time/) guide.

I took photos of almost all stages of our house construction during our second house construction. I checked to see the incident photos...

I took no photos after the incident (after ground floor moulding) for a few days. It is probably because when you are losing ground floor moulding, your focus will only be on fixing the problem, not taking photos.

That's why that guide didn't contain any photos to share...
