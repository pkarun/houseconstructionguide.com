A housewarming function happened on this Akshaya Tritiya day, Fri, 10 May 2024, near my home.

But not many people came for the function.

It could be for two reasons:

1) They planned to do simple.

2) Rainy season

Both are valid reasons only.

By the end of house construction, most homeowners' budgets are over, and they celebrate their housewarming function very simply, calling only close relatives.

I notice the same trend in many cases. 

This is a valid point, and I encourage such things instead of taking extra loans to celebrate functions grandly. That's not my way, at least...

I'm writing this email to share one tip you should remember while planning a housewarming day.

If you want your function to be successful, then don't *keep your function in the rainy season*.

During the rainy season, no one wants to go outside.

When you keep functioning in such a rainy season, visitors will be less.

If the date is so good, then go with it.

If possible, avoid the housewarming function in the rainy season, then avoid it.

Doing functions during the rainy season is just a mess. Just imagine it wet everywhere, with lots of crowds coming during the rainy season.

It's not a good thing for you. It's not good for your visitors as well.

Remember those two points when selecting a date for your housewarming function.

When picking a good date for a housewarming, I have one important tip I wanted to share...

Suppose you really need a good and auspicious date for your housewarming function. In that case, I recommend you follow the tip I shared in the 1.2 section of my Housewarming Function guide.

If you violate that rule, your chances of getting a good date will decrease. This is the lesson I learned from my personal life experience.

More tips related to housewarming functions are shared in my Housewarming Function Guide.
