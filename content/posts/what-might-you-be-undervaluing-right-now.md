Yesterday, when I slept, I went through some of my emails on my mobile.

I came across a meaningful message and thought of sharing it with you.

Here's the message:

---

We undervalue health if we have not recently experienced illness.

We undervalue wealth if we have not recently experienced poverty.

We undervalue kindness if we have not recently experienced cruelty.

We undervalue [avoiding construction mistakes](https://houseconstructionguide.com/products/) until we face problems in a newly built house.

What might you be undervaluing right now?

Ya… the construction point is something I added from my experience.

Each of these statements holds a profound truth. For those who’ve lived through these situations, the meaning resonates deeply.

If the message doesn’t click right away, give it a moment. Reflect on it—you might uncover its depth with time.
