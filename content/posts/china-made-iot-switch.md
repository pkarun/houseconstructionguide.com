While I started implementing the automation switch to my parking light, one device I tried was – the Sonoff switch.

It requires the internet to work. That’s not an issue in my house, as I properly planned everything and can get a Wi-Fi signal anywhere I want in my building. 

It was working fine. 

However, the problem with the device is that it did not last longer because of voltage issues.

I tried 2 or 3 devices, but all failed due to high voltage issues in my area. Within 1 or 2 months, I need to replace these devices.

I tried replacing it for some time. After that, I decided that these China-made devices were not going to work for me. 

The next idea was to develop a self-made IoT device to overcome this device failure issue. 

After researching online, I finally figured out how to build my own IoT device to operate lights and implemented it in my outdoor lights.

Now, this self-made IoT switch worked perfectly fine till now (for a few years) without any issues. 

However, it requires some tech knowledge to troubleshoot if anything happens. For this reason, I have not been interested in teaching this guide until now. 

When I recently discovered a new automation device, I tried it at home, and it worked fine.

After experimenting for a few months and observing its ease of operation, I decided to share this setup guide.

I’m not teaching how to use the automation unit. It's very easy to operate. What I’m teaching in my Outdoor light automation guide is how to set up the proper environment to make such automation an easy task.

No matter what tech changes or automation devices come to market, the setup I share inside my guide is what you need to make your automation job easier.

The setup I recommend inside my guide also saves a lot of money if you decide to implement an automation setup for your outdoor lights.

If you need to handle such a setup in your construction building, get my Outdoor Light Automation guide.
