Last week I went on a Rameshwarm trip. Few back I'm back to my home. After taking enough breaks, I'm writing this email.

This trip is a pretty new experience for me.

I went on some trips… Most are day trips or local trips organised by someone who knows the place.

This time, it's a completely different experience.

All of us are pretty new to the places we visited. We took our own vehicle driven by my brother. 

On this trip, there is one incident that I cannot forget. That is when we visited Meenakshi Amman Temple, Madurai. 

We entered the city at peak hours, and the road was full of traffic. All subroads are small roads. Looking for lodges with such heavy traffic and small roads is very difficult.

We also never planned before…

We started looking at lodges using Google Maps when we visited the city. When we visit the lodge, it's full or no car parking space.

Lodges with car parking space is one of our requirements.

After wasting a few hours looking, I informed my brother to take a vehicle outside the city so we could clearly look for some decent lodges with car parking spaces without traffic issue. 

I believe this is one of the best decisions I took on that day. If I hadn't made such a decision on that day, we could have wasted even more time in such traffic.

After taking vehicle outside the main city, we immediately got a room with a car parking space without much effort.

After experiencing traffic issues in the city, I asked the lodge receptionist how to park near the temple. 

They clearly guided go at 4 am. You can easily take a vehicle right in front of the temple and finish the darshan immediately without much trouble.

As per his suggestion, we left the room at 3.40am. While going, I thought we were the first to visit the temple, as if I were thinking in my head. Many people already stayed in the queue when I went near the Darshan Queue.

Imagine at 4am?

So the lodge receptionist's suggestion worked very well for us.

That's why I always recommend taking suggestions from some experienced users. You always get some insider tips that you won't find in public.

Thanks to the lodge receptionist. With his valuable tip, we finished darsh easily without any parking or traffic headache. 

Similarly, in my house construction guide, I shared some of my lessons and learnings in my guides. 

If you need to know and want to learn from my 2 building construction experience. I recommend getting an [HCG All-Access Pass](https://houseconstructionguide.com/products/#all-access-pass). One or Two ideas are worth all the money you pay for the guide.
