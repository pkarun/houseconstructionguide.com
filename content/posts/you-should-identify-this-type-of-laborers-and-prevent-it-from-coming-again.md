Today our building pending painting work was going onâ€¦

At around 2:30 Pm, my mom and I were playing with my 1-year daughter in my mom's roomâ€¦

My wife came and informed me, "Appa (DAD) is calling youâ€¦ come"

I asked why?

I don't know, comeâ€¦

I went to our house backside and noticed -- my Dad and one Painting laborer had some normal verbal fighting going onâ€¦

### I asked my Dad what had happened.

My Dad replied, "_I was telling him to work instead of speaking in a phone callâ€¦ and he is not ready to listen_."

Talk between him, my Dad, and me where going on regarding his work style.

After some normal to mild verbal fights with that laborerâ€¦ we conclude **that he is not coming to our building work again**.

He also agreed.

We also agreed.

It's a WIN-WIN for both of US.

That laborer then continued his painting work normally from now onâ€¦

This is not the first time we had this issue with this painting laborerâ€¦ it's the second time.

Last time we also had the same issueâ€¦ "having phone conservation while doing work."

When we reported this laborer to our painting contractor first time, he said it wouldn't happen again.

But now, the same complaint again.

### The problem with this laborer isâ€¦

While working, he continuously speaks on the phone for 30min to 45min.

When we asked not to speak while doing work, he says I'm also doing work like that he replies.

The problem with this type of laborers isâ€¦ they are not just lazy in working but also spoil other good working laborers in the work environment.

As soon as you see this kind of BUGS in your building workâ€¦ make sure you prevent such bugs/laborers from coming to your building.

I again reported this laborer to our contractorâ€¦ he also took our side in this matter and agreed not to send him to our building.

### Oh... Just for your informationÂ   
"Our Painting is a contract work."

That means we give a Fixed amount to our contractor, and they finish the discussed work within the budget.Â 

Whatever the Profit or Lossâ€¦ it's on the Contractor.

That meansâ€¦ if laborers are not properly working, it's a direct LOSS to our Contractor.Â 

Not Ours.

Then why do we still monitor laborers?

Becauseâ€¦ when the contract goes out of discussed budget, it's a loss for the contractor.Â 

And Contractor won't pay from his pocket.Â 

What most contractors do isâ€¦ they just stop the work and ask for more payment, or if the owner refuses to pay extra, then they just move from this contract work.Â 

So finally, who will be the loss? **YOU.**Â 

Never assume its contract work, and it's the contractor's job to finish the work within Budget.Â 

You should be more responsible than your contractor.Â 

### one more thing!

If you have these issues with your laborers, it's **OK**.Â 

The thing you should remember is you shouldn't have any kind of issues with your contractors.Â 

You should always handle conversations with your contractor with care and strong backup of what you say ðŸ˜›
