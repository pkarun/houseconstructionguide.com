Yesterday, we went to a few temples far from my home.

When I was praying… the pujari in the temple was speaking on the phone loudly. The conservation caught my attention when Pujari spoke about the LAN cable.

Hmm….

LAN cable? I paid attention to his words while I was there.

The pujari said to the other person on the phone, "I need LAN cable in the daughter's bedroom and other room (maybe the hall). The picture should come clearly… Cost no need to worry."

Based on the conversation I heard, I think the pujari is trying to install a LAN cable on the existing building to watch movies clearly.

They are possibly doing it in the existing building.

It looks like Pujari understood the importance of LAN cable installation in their home (possibly). As the temple is located in Bangalore, I guess he also has a good internet service, so they are doing this work.

Do you know what?

They are hiring skilled technicians to do the job. This means they will be charging based on per-meter charges for this wiring and installation setup.

Not just that…

Per point, they will charge extra as well. Total cost depends on the service providers.

If they do this work after the construction, the wire/pipe will be visible wherever they run the cable. It won't look good.

That's why I recommend that everyone who is going to construct a new house must do their house with a networking setup all over their building.

It is definitely a worthy investment.

Go through my Electrical Work Guide and Internet Everywhere guide. You should be able to save on installation costs as well.

Just read both guides and follow whatever I shared there.

You will be thankful to me once you start using those.

Even if you don't know what you are doing, do it.

One or another day, you will realise the importance of that, and then, you won't need to spend anything on wiring costs.

Pujari realised the importance of LAN cables, but one of my engineer friends didn't realise it while constructing his house.

My friend thought WiFi would do the job.

I don't argue with him because I won't get paid.

If you want to listen to my suggestion, implement what I shared in my Electrical Work Guide and Internet Everywhere guide.

Here, I can recommend best practice because I get paid for doing so…

The choice is yours, as always.
