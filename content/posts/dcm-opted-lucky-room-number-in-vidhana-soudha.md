DCM opted lucky room number in Vidhana Soudha.

hahaâ€¦

It's raining outside, so I didn't go for the night walk.

I just opened the Tv9 Kannada news channel on YouTube to see Rain and Political updates.

I usually don't see newsâ€¦

...but I recently started seeing headlines to see _Congress party Freebie news updates_.

While going through headlines, I just came across one video where D K Shivakumar (Karnataka DCM) Astrologer, informing media that he guided D K to take Room number 336 in Vidhana Soudha because it's his Lucky number!

[Imagine powerful political leaders taking numerology into their life!](https://jsnewstimes.com/karnataka/dk-sivakumar-who-got-lucky-rooms-in-vidhansouda-application-for-siddaramaiahs-residence)

D K Shivakumar is one of Karnataka's most "**Powerful**" and "**Wealthy**" ministers.

If they are all following lucky numbers in their lifeâ€¦ why shouldn't **we** follow that as well?

At least if we got some % of his wealth, isn't it worthy? ðŸ˜ƒ

Anyway, if you got convinced to use numerology for naming, you can use [my bulk name numerology](https://houseconstructionguide.com/bulk-name-numerology-calculator/) calculator to make your job easier.
