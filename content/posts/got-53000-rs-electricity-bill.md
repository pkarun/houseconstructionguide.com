A few days back, a popular Kannada YouTuber uploaded a video showing how he got a ₹53,000 electricity bill for a residential house.

This bill is linked to his house construction, so I thought I would share it here so you will know.

A few years back, he finished his house construction and took a permanent connection from BESCOM through an electrical contractor.

After 3 years, now in the BESCOM bill he got an electricity bill of ₹53,000 for Temporary connection pending bills.

It's not his fault.

It's the Electrical Contractor's and BESCOM's fault.

What happened was that his electrical contractor when surrendered his temporary connection, He was supposed to clear any temporary connection dues and get a permanent connection.

Looks like his contractor, without clearing the temporary connection pending dues, got a permanent connection. BESCOM also accepted this without clearing temporary connection dues.

After 3 years… when the BESCOM auditor did the audit, they billed all the pending charges with a penalty.

Penalty charges are high for a temporary connection, and now he has a 53K bill.

Youtuber took his camera to the BESCOM office and asked all the officials why. He learned that a total of 8,000 users had received such a bill.

Bill going up to 1,00,000rs.

A few months before, a reader emailed me a similar case. I also responded to that email by asking our electrical contractor.

This YouTuber is running behind BESCOM officials to fix the issue, which was probably caused by his electrical contractor or BESCOM officials.

I need to wait and watch for the updates.

What can you learn from this incident?

Suppose you are constructing a house in Bangalore. In that case, there are a few things you must be aware of when picking an Electrical contractor, framing a contract, payment releasing tips & more.

If you think it's easy… no, it's not.

We also got scammed by our first building electrical contractor and learned our lesson the really hard way.

Choosing the wrong electrical contractor costs you a lot in terms of money and time.

When hiring an electrical contractor, ensure you do your groundwork before hiring. If you need my tips, [I shared them here](https://houseconstructionguide.com/electrical-work-guide/).
