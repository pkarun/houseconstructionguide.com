A few days back, one of my Dad's and brother's friends came to our house casually.

They are also staying near our house so they visited.

While my brother and dad were speaking in the first building hall, I was writing that day's email and joined their conversation a little later.

I learned he is now a structural engineer running his own construction business when I went.

As soon as I got to know him, I asked him some construction-related questions. I just want to get some ideas and his viewpoint.

I noted some key points in my Excel sheet for the email ideas.

He answered all my questions, and he couldn't answer some of them. Specifically, some rules-related stuff he didn't know.

He informed me that he had started doing construction in the past 2 years, so he had less knowledge of the subject I asked about.

No problem.

He was sure about the construction-related questions I asked for.

I observed him… the way he sees house construction is somewhat different from what I see.

He is a professional. He speaks what he is trained for…

I write and share my experience living in a constructed house and common mistakes we make while constructing… these are small things.

I never saw those types of conversations coming while I was talking to him.

Professionals treat and think professionally. Users who face issues practically speak differently.

I'm on the user end.

My content and guides are shared on my daily experience of staying and noticing issues in the house.

My ideas & guides are in no way the same as what most engineers & contractors think.

I recommend you also observe the small issues you notice everywhere and try to solve those while doing your house construction.

Most of the time, your contractors or engineers can bypass those small issues.

Those small problems are the ones which annoy you a lot when you move into your new building.

Sometimes, it even costs a lot to fix those. Sometimes, you cannot even fix them.

If you want to learn from my point of view, the [All-Access Pass](https://houseconstructionguide.com/products/#all-access-pass) is where I shared all such small findings.
