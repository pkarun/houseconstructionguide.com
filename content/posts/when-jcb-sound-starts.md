Before bringing JCB to do any work, I have a small tip to share.

Inform the JCB operator to follow only your instructions and not all the visitors.

The reason?

In some cases, if you bring a JCB to do your task, neighbours sometimes ask you or a JCB guy to do the cleaning work here and there.

You cannot say No in front of them. You cannot say Yes also…

Some use such instances very well.

They don't pay for using such a service. They just want to use free service when you bring a JCB vehicle.

It depends on the place and people near your site. This doesn't happen in all places.

Just sharing so you are aware of it. 

Today, I added one more important and a [money-saving tip to the Building Contractor Guide.](https://houseconstructionguide.com/building-contractor-guide/) If you have not yet done your earthwork, read the tip in section 4.68 (46th page).
