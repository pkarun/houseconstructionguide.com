This morning, I got a WhatsApp message from some guy saying --

--

Good to see u r regular updates on home construction

--

Based on the construction image DP, I guess he is in the construction field. Possibly some contractor, I guess.

Whatever may be…

Today, I want to share a small tip related to contractors. This applies to all contractors.

The thing is, I recommend you to always keep in mind that they are in the business to make money.

I see some owners treat them very differently.

I saw one of my dad's friends here. They think they are paying the contractors and must extract as much output as possible.

It doesn't work like that.

If someone is doing work, you should remember that contractors should save money on your project.

If their labourers are not properly working in your building? are their labourers coming daily late?

If you notice such stuff, you must notify your contractor and stop all such activities.

If you think it's the contractor's responsibility and not yours… and he is the one who will lose money. No no…

Don't think or treat like that.

If Contractors didn't save much money at the end of your construction, Give some extra money depending on his nature.

Our construction was never finished within the agreed contract amount for both constructions.

Both our contractors are good. None of them asked for any extra money. We understood they didn't save much in our contract, and we happily paid some extra at the end of construction.

Both are happy.

Even today, we sometimes call our building contractor labourers for some labour tasks. He promptly sent them.

These days, it's very rare for owners to have such a good relationship with their contractors.

It's because owners just think about themself.

Nothing wrong with that.

But I recommend keeping contractors' profit also in mind while doing your construction, and they will happily assist even after your house construction work is over.

Oh.. by the way, we executed our building contracts differently. That's why both contractor didn't save much money.

If we simply went with what the contractors wanted in the agreement, then I'm sure both could have saved from our construction.

My dad is knowledgeable about this agreement framing and wanted to go only with what he suggested. Because of such conditions, contractors didn't save much.

I shared all such contract framing tips inside my Building Contractor Guide.

That's for it today,

Happy weekend,
Arun
