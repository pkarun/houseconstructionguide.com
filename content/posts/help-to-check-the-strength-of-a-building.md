For my email yesterday, I got the below reply from a subscriber:

Hi.

Can you suggest someone who can help to check or strengthen a house building?

We have purchased a old
Building & added a heavy floor on top. Structural and architects were involved though.

The house has load bearing walls.

I don't have any such contacts apart from my building structural engineer.

Moreover, even if I give our engineer contact details, It would cost you more for him to visit your location for a consultation.

Instead, I recommend you search for a structural engineer near the building and do a consultation.

It looks like you have already involved a structural engineer. I hope they did bother checking old building plans and verified pillars (or) added additional pillars before giving yes to construct.

If not. Why not search on Google Maps so you can pick an engineer near your building to do a consultation, which could help.

If you just built one floor on top of an old building, it may not add much stress. But you are also mentioning "Heavy Floor," something I wouldn't dare to DO or Think about doing on any sale building.

For sale buildings or any existing building, they never construct a building while keeping future floors in mind.

The reason? It would significantly increase the building construction cost.

Why would anyone invest now when they don't have a clear picture of their building?

No one would.

Anything invested in foundation work doesn't add any value while selling time. Instead, they could invest the same in their interior, which significantly increasing the building's value.

That's why all sales buildings come with good interiors. Not with extra addable floors feature.

Anywayâ€¦ I highly recommend getting in touch with some or a few structural engineers and consulting once.

Ask any building contractors, labourers, or engineers how well-sale buildings are built. They will give a clear picture of it.

If you are building a house using the labour contract method, [check my guides](https://houseconstructionguide.com/products/), which will help avoid a few first-time user mistakes.
