2 days back, I got a price drop alert on an Amazon product in my email. 

This is the product I thought of buying after when I started using AC in my home office room. I immediately noticed one mistake I made in my room.

This is not just me who usually does…

This is a common mistake made by almost all users in their homes if they use AC.

As soon as I realised this, I tried to find an alternative or temporary solution online and came across the product to fix the problem.

It's a cheap product only…

But it doesn't look that much good from my point of view. For that reason, I'm delaying buying that product and simply tracking the price drop on the cheap product. 

It's one of the most popular products on Amazon, with almost 6,000+ reviews. 

Why so?

Because most of them need that solution to fix that product once construction is over.

They don't realise this mistake at the time of construction. 

Once construction is over, and when they start using AC, they realise the mistake and look for an alternative solution.

Even I made the same mistake in my house.

No one shared about it before…

That's why the alternative solution is so popular, and it sold almost 5,000+ products last month on Amazon India. 

I believe this product is not just bought by AC users. Other home users are using this product for different purposes. 

I'm sure at least some users use it for AC purposes. 

In both houses, I made the same mistake unknowingly. Now, I'm sharing that mistake in my [AC Guide](https://houseconstructionguide.com/products/#20-ac-guide) at 3.13. So you can avoid it and take care of it. 

In the 3.13 section, I shared the problem, the causes of the problem, a temporary solution Amazon product link, and a simple permanent solution that you need to take care of to fix it permanently. 

You will realise how the small things I shared inside my guide will help in the long run. And most of those tips you won't find online… 

This is shared from my practical experience; nobody gives this type of attention to detail. Even your Engineer.

Implement the solution during construction time, even if you don't plan to use AC now. If you decide to use AC in the future, your building will be ready with all the best practices. 

Open the pdf file and see the 3.13 section if you already have access.
