For the past 1 week, I didn't send any mail, the reason is… our family went to some functions in different places so it took almost 4 to 5 days to come back to my Home.

The journey was like Home -> function place 1 -> home town -> function place 2 -> Back to Home.

After coming back, I took a few more day's rest.

Now here I'm.

I don't like to travel much… these few day's journeys are boring. Especially the waiting part in functions places.

While I was waiting in my room at function place 1… I noticed something.

#### Water _OVERFLOWING_  
in overhead tanks

It's not just in one place.

Wherever I look there… the same thing.

In almost all the buildings, anytime they ON the motor, water will overflow for a few minutes to a few hours.

I felt bad seeing it. I couldn't do anything about it.

If they had installed automatic water level controllers, many could have avoided water wastage issues. But seems like no one has installed it in that location.

There could be a few reasons for it:

\- Owners are not aware of the unit

\- Owners have wrong assumptions about the device

\- No one offering installation service over there

\- or for any other reason.

If you are also having same issue... It will be fixed today.

#### We have been using it for almost 3+ Years  
without any issues

The water level controller is a must-have device for every house. We have been using the same device for almost 3+ years without issues.

It saves the waste of water, time, energy, and money.

I highly recommend everyone install this device in your buildings.

You need to keep a few things in mind if you are building a new building and don't have any idea about the water level controller.

I have written everything about it in a blog post.
