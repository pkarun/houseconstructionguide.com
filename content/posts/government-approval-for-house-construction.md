The owner or the builder has to get the approval from a different authority like [BBMP](http://bbmp.gov.in/), [BDA](http://bdabangalore.org/eng/), [BMRDA](http://bmrda.karnataka.gov.in/), and Gram Panchayath etc. The following documents as to submit to get approval from above authority.

1.  Registered deed document complete set 1set
2.  EC, RTC, each one copy
3.  Geometrical layout plan blueprint 4 sets
4.  Estimation of the building 1 set

Residential building constriction in Bangalore makes you run around the government offices forever if you don't know the right process in my opinion. Most of the people hire an agent for getting approval on square feet basis. For example, we paid â‚¹15,000 for 1500 square feet layout plan approval in Bangalore.

After getting construction approval we can start the house construction process.
