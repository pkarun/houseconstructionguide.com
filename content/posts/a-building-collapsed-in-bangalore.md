I hope you have already come across the building collapse news in Bangalore today.

After seeing the building falling clip and images, I noticed it's mostly foundation and pillars fault.

If you properly notice the pillars on that building, only a few can be seen there. And the pillars size? Too small for a G+3+2 building.

Who is to blame?

Engineer or Owner or Contractor?

In this case, it seems the owner is at fault.

I don't think any engineer would give such a low-quality plan for a G+5-floor building.

After reviewing the news, I noticed one contractor built G+3 floors. And nobody shared who built the remaining 2 floors.

Maybe the contractor also got scared while building itself and left the work partially?

It happens.

Contractors also don't show interest in building sub-par quality buildings. If something goes wrong, they are also held responsibleâ€¦

Or the [contractor might had a dispute with the owner](https://houseconstructionguide.com/house-construction-tracking-system/) and left the project without finishing?

Whatever may be the reason.

When you are planning to construct, clearly share how many floors you need to build so engineers can properly calculate load and design plans accordingly.

If you want to build 1 floor now and a few floors later, share the same with engineers.

They plan for all the floors and provide the plan.

I got a few user queries about users who bought a sale building and now planning to extend one or two floors.

I straightly tell them, don't bother doing that.

If you still want to do it, then consult the engineer. They will add a few pillars before raising the floors.

Because of such low-quality construction, all the users involved in that property will now suffer.

Whatever the project you handle, don't mindlessly build cheap quality buildings. This statement applies to Owners, Engineers & Contractors as well.

Lots of users suffer because of this.

Don't get involved in such projects if you don't have control.
