Our family attended a relative marriage function in Hassan for the last two days.

Function finished successfully.

I guess this is probably one of the grandest weddings I have attended… It came out that good.

I felt they overspent little for this marriage.

My thought process never allows me to overspend that much for functions.

It's just my opinion.

Our relative booked a lodge for our stay.

As soon as I start working on this house's construction-related content, I usually pay attention to any type of construction-related activity.

Similarly, I have been paying much attention to Lodges as well.

I noticed that lodges have different setups from any typical house or rental property.

From power supply to water supply, light setup, hot water supply, lock system, bed setup, toilet setup, etc., all have completely different setups compared to normal houses.

Why do they do such things?

To improve operational efficiency and save cost.

This is the same for all the lodges that I have visited recently.

Why am I sharing this? The reason is…

If you plan to include a rental unit in your construction, there are a few things you should keep in mind at the time of construction.

These rental property tips will help you to maximize operational efficiency, rent faster, and save money.

This is some knowledge that I gained after managing our own rental units.

I will be sharing all those tips and lessons in my upcoming guide, Rental Property Guide.

Now the guide is almost ready. It will soon be added to the member's area.

A Small changes in the setup could save money on the maintenance of the property.
