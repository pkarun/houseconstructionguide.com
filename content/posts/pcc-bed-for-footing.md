After [digging the earth](https://houseconstructionguide.com/excavation-in-construction/), the next step is preparing a PCC (Plain Cement Concrete) Bed for Footing.

In this step, whatever the excavated place/trench is there, they will put some jelly first, and later msand and cement mix will be added on top of it.

This is not like concreating… but they add some cement with msand.

It [will be cured for a few days](https://houseconstructionguide.com/curing-in-house-construction/)… while other work continues in parallel.

Once this process is done, you don't see the soil. Instead, you will see some type of concrete mix.
