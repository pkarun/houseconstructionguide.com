I didn't get a better title idea than the above title, so I'm going with it.

Anyway, my point is. I already shared such an [incident recently](https://houseconstructionguide.com/to-give-or-not-to-give/). Again I had another such incident keep happening—here is the story about it. 

We had one house construction labor from our building contractor. We prefer him for any kind of cleaning job. He does the cleaning job Perfectly, so we tell our contractor to send him only.

We also treat him well when he comes to work.

The thing is, Once he asked for **₹100** for some emergency work, and as always, my DAD gave him. He said he would return.

You know what?

He didn't RETURN.

We also didn't bother asking him. 

Again after a few days, He asked ₹100… the same story; he said he would return. But never bother to return.

Our dad also won't ask.

He couldn't have asked the second time if we had collected back the first time. 

But we didn't. 

He learned the LOOPHOLE and started making use of it.

I know this cycle continues until we Ask or he stops coming to work.

He only asked for ₹100. We have such incidences with ₹500 and ₹3000 as well. Some we intentionally left without collecting back. Some we forcefully collected it.

So you decide whether you want to practice such behavior with your laborers or not. It's all in your hand.

I personally don't like developing such a habit.
