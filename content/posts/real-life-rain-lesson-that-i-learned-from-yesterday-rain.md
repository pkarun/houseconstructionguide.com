Today at 10 Am, I came to my home office to start work.

I noticed something.

I called my Dad to discuss about it. We both went and verified the root cause of that issue.

Later, we learned that it had happened due to yesterday's rain.

We went back to the first house to have breakfast. While my dad and I were discussing about the issue, my mom also listened to our conversation about the rain problem that we noticed recently.

She also shared something similar she noticed in one of our neighbour's houses a few days back (as it's raining now).

I updated my Rainy Days guide after noticing our and our neighbour's issues.

If you have access, please download the latest version to learn from my and our neighbour's mistakes.

I added images to explain the concept that happened in our house.

Regarding our neighbour's mistake, I just shared a guide to avoid that mistake so you can be careful during your house construction.

The updated sections are in 2.7, Example 2, and 2.9 in the Rainy Days Guide.

No matter who you hire for your house construction work, it's your responsibility to properly take care during house construction time.

Or else you are the one who pays the price later.

That's why I'm sharing all my lessons inside my guides so smart people [who invested in my guides](https://houseconstructionguide.com/products/) can learn and avoid making my mistakes in their building.

Whatever problem we noticed in our building is mostly fixableâ€¦ but in our neighbour's case, it costs a lot to fix permanently. That's why they do manual work every time it rains to prevent further damage to the building.
