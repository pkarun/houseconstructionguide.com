When we built the first house, we learned a lot of lessons. One such lesson is, Tracking Everything related to House Construction Activity.

Although we tracked a few things in our first house, when the problem arrived, we realized what stupid mistakes we made.

We realized all such mistakes at finishing time, and we had no other option besides dealing with the contractors calmly.

One such incident was on our first building when all the electrical work was done, and while doing his final settlement, he demanded more than the discussed amount. We had some verbal fights that day, and at the time, our contractor asked only one thing - "**What proof do you have?**"

hmmâ€¦ Yes, on that day, we didn't have any Proof.

Our Mind is blown when our Contractor Asked that QuestionÂ ðŸ¤¯

But it's too late for us. We left with no option apart from Paying the Extra Amount he Demanded (I guess it's aroundÂ **â‚¹15,000**), settled his payment, and said Goodbye to that Contractor.

See, it's Not Just about the Extra Payment we dealt with; we also faced verbal fights and headaches handling such situations.

When we got a chance to build our 2nd building, I knew I needed to change the Tracking System we used on our first building.

I tried different ways during our 2nd house construction, and after many trials and errors, I finally found a proper method.

And I can Proudly say theÂ _New House Construction Tracking System_Â Works Flawlessly!

I'm very happy about How it helped us whenever we got in trouble during our 2nd house construction.

Yes. The new House construction Tracking system helped in many instances without trouble.

It takes a few minutes to a few hours, depending on the problem's nature.
