These are the terms I used inside my [Toilet Septic Tank Guide](https://houseconstructionguide.com/toilet-septic-tank-guide/). 

These are the types of users I categorised based on how they plan their septic tanks in their houses.

Now, what I'm going to do in this email is I'm going to take the live example of the houses that are constructed on the backside of my house. This is the main road I must use regularly to go anywhere.

A total of 12 houses are constructed on the main road. Let me categorise how many houses come in which category.

Underestimated Owners: 8

Overestimated Owners: 2

Rightway: 2

This is the current live stats. 

In this, one civil engineer house also comes. Currently, their house falls under the Underestimated Owners category.

Oh, by the wayâ€¦ as explained in the guide, the engineer did spend some money hiring labourers when maintenance time came. Which happened a few months before. 

You don't need my guide if you think you come in Rightway category owners. 

If not, you must follow my guide to have a stress-free & to save money when maintenance time comes:
