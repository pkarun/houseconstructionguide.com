I've been trying to order a wet grinder for my home from last month onwards.

As always, I placed an order on Amazon.in initially.

However, for the first time, I was not confident about placing the order because of the reviews and photos shared in the reviews section.

Most of the users commented on the product's damage in reviews.

Still, after thinking a lot, I proceed with the order.

The product came as per the scheduled time.

This time, instead of blindly accepting the product, I checked the box condition… The box looks pretty old.

It had some damage to the box.

Instead of accepting the product, I decided to reject it.

I did a good job rejecting on the spot instead of raising return requests later.

After gaining a decent amount of experience, I have learned some lessons. These days, returns and replacement rules are quite strict.

We must properly verify the packages before accepting them, or later, we must spend time dealing with customer support.

For cheaper items, replacement happens easily. For costlier items, you may need to spend some time.

After seeing the box's condition, my brother and I decided to shop in offline shops.

We also went to a few shops to see the product… but only a few models were available.

Again, we came back home to try placing an order online.

This time, we tried Flipkart.

We didn't blindly order here also… because Flipkart is more dangerous than Amazon regarding replacements and refund processes.

Before placing the order, we checked the Seller's History and his rating.

Believe me, whenever you are trying to order anything online, one of the important things you need to do is check the seller.

Never order any costly or important items before checking who the seller is.

I will pick the better one if they don't have enough ratings and history. Even if it costs more.

I never think about paying more for a trusted seller than for a new seller.

I learned that painful lesson by buying one item online, which was required during house construction.

Because of that mistake, I'm still suffering even after 1 year.

I don't know if it will be fixed or if I will continue to suffer because of the mistake.

When I learned about my mistake, I opened my order history and checked the seller.

The seller is no longer there on the platform. Product listing is also no longer on sale.

That time, I understood the importance of checking the seller before ordering.

I recommend you follow the same rule.

If you want to know what happened and what problem I'm facing… All that information is shared in my Electrical Work Guide in the 5.65 section.

Not just that… many first-time users' mistakes they commonly make are all those shared inside my guides. These are not technical stuff.

These are simply tips many don't give attention to during construction and suffer later.

Even professional engineers make those mistakes. I shared a few such incidents with my guides.

If this interests you, I recommend getting an HCG All-Access Pass to access all my current and future guides.

Learn from my mistakes and avoid doing those in your house construction.

By the way, Flipkart delivered our wet grinder in excellent condition. Waiting tomorrow to see the grinder performance by preparing idli batter.
