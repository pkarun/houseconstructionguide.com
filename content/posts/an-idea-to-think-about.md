The day before yesterday, I talked about a movie I watched…

Today's email is about the same topic. Which is related to a movie but in a different way.

If you regularly read my emails, you might notice some changes we made at home, which helped us.

Recently, we disconnected the DTH connection, and now we completely rely on the Internet, YouTube, and OTT apps for entertainment in my home.

It would be a good move if you could ask me.

No more time wasted on watching useless ads and getting updated entertainment at our fingertips.

However, not all can implement this in their home because you need a good broadband (internet) connection with unlimited data and a [proper network plan to enjoy 4K videos without buffering.](https://houseconstructionguide.com/internet-everywhere/)

If you don't have those, you cannot enjoy them properly.

If you are a light internet user, then no issues. 

If you are a heavy consumer, OTT will not help with the fake unlimited data with what other major service providers are offering.

To my knowledge, Excitel is the only major internet provider offering a truly unlimited plan.

If you have Excitel near your house, upgrade your TV to 4K and the latest version to truly enjoy entertainment at your house.

I don't tell this easily.

Regarding entertainment, you might seen a trend of having a separate home theater.

If you will build only an owner-stay house and have a budget to build one extra floor/room for the home theater, do it.

See… till now, I never saw any value in those home theater.

Now, after seeing some changes in my home after upgrading the old TV to a new 4K TV, Old DTH to OTT Apps, and [a good Home theater for a better sound system.](https://www.amazon.in/Sony-HT-S20R-Soundbar-Bluetooth-Connectivity/dp/B084685MT1?crid=3DYJA9258WK83&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ZM-4CVTfULqB6jxUj7Mp8LCqTZ4S6haIgbmOVE0onE0gp-AYSvZouI_h6I26lDzslRPgToZhVgEkStV1dXzX6osa7t340lLQvMYUghZfBf16Tmga9Q4QMM_CaAxziDqPFWfaqmitWQc7XrrmahGoDedeYK6N-5zriZ7Q1LJC-gLMLrbNIZznr8-GqDbiXcaQL2YlYevSMaq5yQjQD-3Pw4-2XFrKeFupnY772peAloI.OKc2ZsoGUux1n6MwgTnf849P75nq24RfGINDUS8PAE8&dib_tag=se&keywords=SONY%2BHT-S20R%2B5.1ch&nsdOptOutParam=true&qid=1730728398&sprefix=sony%2Bht-s20r%2B5.1ch%2B%2Caps%2C186&sr=8-1&th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=newsite0003-21&linkId=24fc193cac16bce75d32d583b178b3e2&language=en_IN&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) It's truly a different entertainment.

It's never happened before.

I used to watch 1 or 2 movies a year on my PC. Now I watch 1 movie a week with all my family members.

Oh.. you might count time waste. 

Ya, that's right. But the feeling and energy after spending time with the whole family is worth spending 3 hrs watching a movie at home.

We don't have a dedicated home theater room in our house. We cannot do that. Because it requires some good space & a good budget.

Everything we watch and enjoy is in the Hall itself. 

Suppose you are building some luxury home, duplex, or triplex. In that case, you can consider having a separate floor or room for a home theater.

Most owners will be on a tight budget during construction time; if that's your case, just build the extra floor or room and don't bother doing any false ceiling or home theater setup during construction.

Don't keep windows on the home theater floor/room; it isn't required. Having windows actually costs more than without windows.

Once you are comfortable with the budget, hire professionals who take care of all those.

A quick search for home theater services on Google Maps will get a list of popular service providers in your area.

I will share my first reaction to seeing a home theater system tomorrow.

I still laugh at how I changed my view once I experienced myself in my home.
