Are you going to buy an Invitation card for your housewarming function?

You don't always need an Invitation card to inviteâ€¦

It depends on you.

If you need an invitation card, then read this or else skip this.

Ok.

When you buy invitation cards, remember you need to bring a little bit extra cards.

When you give your invitation card for printing, they waste a few cards for printing setting/adjustment.

It's a common process.

I saw somewhere in the review section one guy bought a little costly invitation card and is now shouting at store owners and the printing press team for missing 20 cards.

Both the store owner and the printing press team blamed each other.

Don't be that guy. If you are not ready to lose a few cards in printing, don't buy them.

And not just that. You must remember a few other important things before you even visit shops to buy an Invitation card.

I shared about those invitation card stuff in the 1.4, 1.5, and 1.6 sections of my Housewarming Function Guide.
