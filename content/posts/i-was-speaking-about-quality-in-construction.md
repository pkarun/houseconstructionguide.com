Continuing yesterday's conversation with a structural engineer, I asked if you really provide quality work with material contract projects.

He replied, Ya. I always maintain quality.

But, it won't be the same with general labour contractors. He mentioned.

He gave one example.

Usually, general labour contractors don't offer meshwork during sump construction. I always provide that without failure.

That's his version of the statement.

I believe it depends on the owner's budget; they also need to skip a few things here and there…

No one will give from their own pocket.

He only does material contract work. No labour contact.

I asked him, don't you face any difference with the owner.

He said in the Agreement that we give a price range for each item. The owner will pay the difference if they want to buy anything out of the range.

Do you think you can mention all the items in the agreement?

"Main items only we mention." Small things we don't.

I asked how many pages your agreement contains.?

He replied around 4 Pages.

I thought of asking for his version of the material contract agreement. But I didn't feel it was right to ask him.

So I didn't ask.

My Building labour contract agreement contains 8 pages of content without me even talking about the product price range.

I'm unsure how he put all the important terms and conditions in just 4 pages.

As this is an agreement from the contractor, I guess he just took care of what he wanted to protect himself.

This is the case with almost all contractors, not just with my friend.

These are the kinds of agreements I don't recommend you to sign directly.

There is no issue if everything is fine between you and the contractor. If any difference comes, that's where the problem starts.

Having the right kind of detailed agreement protects you and the contractor.

I don't have a material contract agreement template, but I have a Detailed Labour Contract Agreement template.

If you use the Labour Contract method to construct your house, you can use my agreement template.

Watch how detailed my labour contract agreement is >>
