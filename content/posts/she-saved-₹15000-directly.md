Yesterday, I shared how one of our relatives planned to buy a 50K laptop in an offline shop.

This email is a continued version of that story…

Both father and daughter went to offline shops to buy laptops because they don't trust online shops. 

When they enquired about the laptop price they planned to buy, the shop owner told them ₹15,000 more than what they could get on an online shopping site now.

They tried to ask for an online price, but the shop owner was not ready to give it.

Yesterday night, their daughter called my brother to inform the story and wanted to buy online now.

The problem is that they don't have much courage to buy 50K products online directly, and asked my brother to buy and keep them in our house. 

Once the product is delivered, she will come and pick up the laptop.

Finally… they did a good job shopping online instead of offline shop.

If you had seen my email yesterday, you might have noticed that I predicted 5K to 20K extra that they would have to pay if they bought in offline shops.

Now she revealed that 15K extra is what local shops asked her for.

That's why I love online shopping. 

We can save even more during special sales like this with bank card discounts.
