If you fill excess soil inside your site, make space wherever the plinth beam will come. Then, PCC bedding will be done wherever the plinth beam will come.

Now, the barbender will prepare the plinth beam.

Centring team will do centring wherever the plinth beam comes.

The building contractor will pour concrete inside the plinth beam.

After all these tasks, you must fill the soil inside the plinth beam and stop water to compress the soil. Once the soil gets settled well, remove any excess soil inside the plinth beam.

You should remove soil so that they need to put jelly, msand and cement (like PCC work) on top of it. This should not cross the plinth beam height.
