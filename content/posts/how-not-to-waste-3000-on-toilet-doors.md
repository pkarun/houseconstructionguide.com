When I went on the Rameshwarm trip, I noticed a similar issue, which I shared in my Toilet Door Privacy Issue guide (6.1).

In that guide, I only shared content without any video footage. Because I didn't have any… 

Although we temporarily fixed our toilet door when the door was having an issue at that time, I didn't take any video footage. I had no idea I would create house construction-related guides like this at that time.

Anyway, when we were staying at Premium AC Lodge in Rameshwaram, I noticed a similar issue with the lodge toilet door. 

They spent quite good money on the interior and all… and are taking no shortcuts to save money. Still, without having practical experience, they also installed a door that was not recommended by ME in their lodge.

The toilet door has already had an issue within a few years (it's a brand-new lodge). 

This time, I didn't miss the chance to take video footage. By watching the video, you can understand the issues with this particular type of toilet door, avoid making similar mistakes in your house, and save money & time. 

I guess the door used in the lodge toilet door costs more than ₹3,000. It's feels premium… Just for the context here, I'm mentioning 3K.

I'm not mentioning that all such types of doors cause similar issues. I believe few such types of doors are having such issues. That's what I observed in my house.

I'm sure that lodge toilet doors need to be replaced within a few years because of such common issues with the door, or else they won't be able to operate the door itself.

**I updated my [Toilet Door Privacy Issue guide.](https://houseconstructionguide.com/toilet-door-privacy-issue/)** 

If you have an All-Access pass, log in to the member's area and download the updated content to see the video footage of the toilet door issue I shared in the **7.1** section and avoid using such type of door as suggested in the guide.

If you buy the right type of doors initially, you won't waste money on such problematic ones. 

That's what we did in our second building. 

Others who don't have access to the material just use costly toilet doors instead of cheap ones, or you can get all my guides just for the price of buying one problematic door which you might need to replace in the future so that you could save money and your time. 

In my guides, you get way more insider tips. The choice is yours… If you are interested, [here is where to get it.](https://houseconstructionguide.com/products/#all-access-pass)
