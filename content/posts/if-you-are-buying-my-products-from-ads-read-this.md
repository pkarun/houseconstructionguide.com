Yesterday, a buyer emailed me to ask about the product he paid for but has not yet received.

I searched his email in my email system to see what product he had purchased.

I noticed 3 products he bought, and he is also on my email list for quite a few days.

I believe this user is buying only from some offers that I make on running ads on Facebook.

I don't know who else is doing similar things. It's pretty difficult to go and check all those details.

If you are also doing the same, understand the logic of offering discounts on Facebook ads and not here.

I'm offering a good ad deal because I need to attract customers who will likely buy my future products.

Ads are costly to run. We don't make money on ads. It's just a tool to attract the right customer with product buyer's funds. Not from our pocket money. That's all.

That means I only run ads for selected products, not all.

If you properly calculate the cost you are paying for a single product is still more than the price you could get from my All-Access Pass.

Do some calculations you will understand.

Moreover, I only run ads for a few products, not all.

So, if you repeatedly buy my products, the best way is to buy my All-Access Pass. Not buying through ads. As you never see ads for all my products,

With my All-Access Pass, you can always get any updates or future guides at no extra cost.

All you need to do is log in to the member's area to find the latest or updated guide.

Anyway, I just wanted to share this with you to make you a better-informed buyer.

I don't want to play such games with my email subscribers. I could make quick cash by doing thatâ€¦ but it definitely not gonna help my buyers much.

I want [my subscribers to buy my All-Access Pass](https://houseconstructionguide.com/products/#All-Access-Pass) (who can offered, If not also no issues). This is where they get all the common mistakes they could make and how to avoid them during construction time.

Which could help them for the lifespan of the building. 

Anyway, The next guide I'm working on is for users planning to build rental property in their building.

I will share all the lessons I learned in this guide after having 16+ door rental units. You can learn and implement the suggestions I shared in your property to avoid mistakes.

It will also be added inside the All-Access Pass members area at no extra cost.
