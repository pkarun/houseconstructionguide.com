Today, we scheduled our painter for a repainting task on the ground floor [rental property](https://pkarun.com/tags/rental-property/), and he was carrying out his painting work. This painter's work also involves cleaning as well. 

While cleaning the toilet, he noticed the water was not going properly... it's taking time.

That's when he called us to see what happened.

My dad went and saw the issue. He went backside the house and noticed some water coming out of the pit chamber as well. Which is actually a closed one. 

That's when he realised our Toilet pit/septic pit was full. 

We have never experienced this issue in our house. We were staying on the first floor and noticed this issue on the ground floor.

We enquired about the next-door rental unit, and those tenants confirmed that the toilet water slowly going issue happened in the past two days. But it's getting fixed automatically, so they didn't bother informing us. 

When we only talked to them about the issue then, they shared their issues. 

If we hadn't asked, none of the tenants could have alerted us until we noticed a similar issue on the first floor.

Usually, when the toilet pit is filled, first ground-floor users notice toilet water moving slowly... 

And then the remaining floors notice. 

It's better to inform ground floor users if they notice any such issues in the toilet and bring them to your attention immediately before the issue reaches to other floors. 

## What's Next? 

Once you find out your toilet pit is full, the next step is to arrange for pit-cleaning service providers. Before you call them, make sure the pit pipe is visible. 

It's your responsibility to make the cap visible. They don't wait once they reach the spot. 

For me, this is the first time calling such a service. So I opened my Google Maps and searched. 

- pit cleaning service near me

Looked for a service provider near my location with good ratings and reviews and called them.

Before calling them, I have a tip for you. One of the guys who had worked in that industry shared this tip.

One thing we need to remember when the pit cleaning vehicle comes is to check the gauge on the vehicle. The gauge should be empty. (Verticle transparent pipe, not pressure gauge)

Some service providers come with half-filled vehicles; most users don't notice that. After the work is done, that gauge should show as full. 

So when I called them, I asked if they show empty Gauge before starting work.

They replied. Yes, we will show that. 

I asked how much it would cost?

They told me â‚¹1,500 per trip. 

I booked them after knowing my answers. 


## Pit Cleaning Vehicle Came...

After 4 to 5 follow-ups with the service provider, they finally came. This is my first time seeing or using this type of service.

Here's How it went.

I showed them the pit pipe cap, and they opened it easily with the hook they bought. Put the pipe inside the pipe. They open the valve in the vehicle to suck the waste inside the pit. 

Within 10 minutes, the cleaning vehicle job was over. 

On the vehicle's backside, on the left side, there is one verticle transparent pipe. It shows how much the vehicle tank is getting filling live. Once the level is filled, they close the valve on the vehicle and take the pipe.

That's all.

It's a very fast process. This process hardly takes 10 minutes. 

There won't be any smell or mess happening during this process. The hardest task you have to do is -- showing where the pipe opening is there. 

That's it. 

Based on this experience, ~~I will be writing a guide~~ I have writen a [toilet septic tank guide](/toilet-septic-tank-guide/) & adding [inside members area](/products/) on how to plan a septic tank properly during your house construction so it gets easy during maintenance time. 

This guide is unnecessary if UGD (Underground Drainage) is available.
