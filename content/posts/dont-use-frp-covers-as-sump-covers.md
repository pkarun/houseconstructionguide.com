I'm just back from the temple and writing this email calmly.

From the last two days onwards, while I was casually watching YouTube shorts, I came across videos where the sump cover is covered with an [FRP Cover](https://www.amazon.in/s?k=frp+covers&crid=2SNG738ETDCLA&sprefix=frp+covers%2Caps%2C263&linkCode=ll2&tag=newsite0003-21&linkId=0f95c521f2bbefe4d09cb687d4d2c3ee&language=en_IN&ref_=as_li_ss_tl).

What an irony…

Even some experienced builders make the same mistake when they construct buildings. I came across that in one YT video recently. That's why I'm writing this email.

Once, one of my friends in my village also asked for suggestions about using FRP for a sump cover….

I clearly told them not to use that for the sump cover. It's not designed for that.

They look cool and hold good weight on them. For this reason or whatever reason, some of them using it to cover their sump opening.

Please don't make such a mistake.

The reason is -- **Safety**.

They are lightweight and don't have a locking system in them. So anyone can easily open those closed FRP covers of your sump.

Even small kids can open that cover. It's that easy and lightweight to open.

Imagine some kids, while playing, opened that cover and fell inside the sump?

Who will be responsible?

You may think we don't have kids, so it won't be a problem.

Currently, you may not have any kids, but in future, you may have.

If you have that FRP system, there is no way you can easily replace them unless you replace that with an MS or SS sump cover.

Currently, in the market, as of my knowledge, these FRP covers don't come with any locking system. So, I don't recommend using that to cover your sump.

Instead, use that MS/SS sump cover to cover your sump. Use these FRP covers for inspection chambers that you do inside your house.

Never take safety for granted under any circumstance.

My opposite house owner has 2 children with them. They almost always lock the sump cover with a lock.

If they were using these FRP covers, they couldn't lock the sump cover.

In our house, we also have two kids under 2 years of age. They are not yet going to the ground floor without our absence. Once they start going, we also lock the sump cover.

Safety is first.

When it comes to safety, another thing I recommend you to consider is the handrail thing.

In my Railings guide, I Explained how to handle Railings safety concerns. Which is a must-have thing.

Unfortunately, many fail to implement it in their new building due to a lack of knowledge.

If you read my guide, you will understand what you need to take care of to implement the right thing in your building during construction.

Because of making this mistake, some of them lose their lives.

One of my own relatives lost her life recently because of the same reason.
