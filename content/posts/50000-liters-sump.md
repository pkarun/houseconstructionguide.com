Yesterday, I met with some users who came looking for rental units. We had one vacancy, so they came to our house to inquire about the vacant property.

While we casually discussed, he asked about any water issues in this area like they asked.

When discussing this water topic, one of the parents replied that he had a 50,000 Ltr sump in their building, which they use for garage purposes.

I was quite shocked listening to that sump capacity.

I felt I was supposed to listen to 15,000 ltr, and I might have mistakenly heard… so to confirm again, 15 or 50 like I asked. 

He replied, 50…

Ok, I heard right. He is saying 50,000 Ltr sump capacity. 

That's a really nice capacity. In most cases, I don't think many common users who build houses give much importance to sump capacity.

They just go with standard sizes like 7,000 to 15,000 ltrs sump as recommended by their contractors.

The smaller the sump size, the less it costs to build. 

If you just think like that, you must keep one thing in mind. 

If you build a sump smaller than the required sump capacity for your needs, you will pay more in the long run.

How?

Suppose water doesn't come for 1 week or 2 weeks. In that case, you need to depend on tankers… tanker water is always costlier, and the price always keeps increasing. 

Users who are aware of this fact know the importance of sump size and plan properly and build the right sump size. Which is definitely gonna help them in the long run.

Many first-time home construction users are never aware of such facts.

They just want to finish the house within their budget, take shortcuts and suffer later.

The above owner asked about water scarcity and water sources before finalizing the rental property. Not all will be aware of such things unless they practically face such issue themself. 

This is called real experience. 

In my [sump construction guide 1.1 section](https://houseconstructionguide.com/sump-construction-guide/), I included a sump capacity calculator to help new users avoid building under-size sump and suffer later.

This calculator is built based on the real use case in our house. You just need to enter a few variables to get the recommended sump capacity for your use case.

Building the right size sump is more important to avoid water issues.

Don't randomly build sump size. Properly plan and build the sump of the right size.
