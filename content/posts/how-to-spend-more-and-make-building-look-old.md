We went to ask about cot pricing for our rental unit a few days back. I noticed a construction buildingâ€¦

The building installed a Granite Wall Cladding all over it.

Do you know how it looks? BORING. Like an old building look.

Granite is good for flooring work, not for wall cladding work. It won't look good.

I recommend using 2 by 4 Double glazing Tiles for wall cladding for a premium look.

Still in confusion?

Watch any YouTube videos where sale buildings or interior work is done.

They all use Tiles.

In our first house, we also did granite wall cladding, thinking more expensive == more premium looks.

It won't work like that.

Granite wall cladding costs more than tiles. But look-wise, nothing beats Tiles.

Don't keep thinking spending more makes your building look more beautiful.

Nope. Not always.

I still see many new buildings with granite wall cladding, which most older generation prefers.

Don't make the same mistakes as others do.

Think and make decisions.

Granite is a good choice for maintenance-free flooring.

Suppose you want to use granite flooring and want to know the granite pricing and labour charges we paid. In that case, I have shared all those details inside my Our House Construction Expenses product.

Sometimes, it helps to know the price on average to better negotiate with the sellers.
