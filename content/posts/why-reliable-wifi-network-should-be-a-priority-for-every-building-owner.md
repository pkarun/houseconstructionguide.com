I don't usually recharge my mobile with a huge data plan because, in my home, I always connect my mobile to WiFi, which has better speed and unlimited data.

I only use my mobile data when I go outside.

When I was in the lodge, I checked if the lodge offered WiFi services.

In most cases, this is a mandatory service almost all lodges offer.

They also have a Free WiFi network in the lodge where I stayed.

While thinking about a password, I noticed the lodge network didn't ask for a password for me to connect.

So, I directly connected without asking the receptionist for a WiFi password.

This is the wrong way to offer WiFi service.

Anyone can easily connect to the open network, which is not a good idea regarding security and usability.

As soon as I entered my lodge room, my phone's WiFi signal was gone. I am no longer able to connect to Lodge's free WiFi signal.

Looks Lodge offered internet service only for the namesake purpose.

I can only use their WiFi outside the room and standing in the passage. Not even able to sit also.

Hmm… I turned off my phone's WiFi and turned on my mobile Data.

Even though they have a networking setup in their lodge, they set it up in such a way so no one can use their service.

From my assumption, they did this setup for advertisement purposes only, or the network guy didn't properly educate the lodge owner or service provider didn't bother to do his job properly to avoid the difficult tasks.

Whatever might have happened, the network set up in the lodge where I stayed a few days back is useless.

If you see my network setup in our two buildings, you will see the right way to do it.

All our tenants enjoy freaking awesome internet service (WiFi) in all their units, no matter where they stay near their units.

They always get Full signal, Good Speed… Best Internet Experience inside their house they might ever experienced anywhere. 

That's how anyone should plan if you are going to offer internet service, or else don't bother offering just for namesake WiFi.

No one will go outside to use the internet. It's not the best experience.

I don't know how much experience you have with network setup, but I shared my recommended network setup for construction building in my Internet Everywhere Guide.

Read it, Understand it and Implement it.

Don't just rely on the knowledge of service providers. Sometimes, they take shortcuts to save themself from doing the right work.

If you know the work, you can guide them according to your plan. Not just what they suggest you to do.

If WiFi is almost mandatory in Lodges, don't you think it should also be in your building as well?
