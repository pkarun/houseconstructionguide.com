I realised this problem after having our own house. Until we had our own house, we used to stay in the rental property and never have to worry about outdoor lights.

In most cases, the owner takes care of that. In some cases, no one ON the outdoor lights.

Life goes without worrying about homeowners' problems :)

Then we had our first house; that time, our house was on the first floor. Every day we need to turn on/off the parking lights.

Anyone of our family members used to ON the lights during evening time. During sleep time, my brother or I usually have to turn off lights daily.

That’s when I realised the problem of maintaining lights is not easy. 

It’s boring and time-consuming (getting from the 1st floor to the ground floor is not easy, huh), and it's a repetitive task that we used to do daily. 

I knew I didn’t want to do this type of task daily… I need to do something to fix such repetitive tasks. So I started looking for some solution. 

I didn’t find any promising solutions at first. After someday I started trying different products online and experimenting with parking lights.

Some solutions worked for a few days, some had some technical difficulties, and finally, I decided to build my own product to solve this solution.

I did it. It worked very well till today. 

For my system to work, to make it affordable, for maintenance and repair work, I needed to do a different kind of setup in my home. 

At first, I didn’t have that setup in my first home. I kept this point in mind for the second building. 

When we started our second building, I knew everything required for my own IoT device to work, prepared such a proper environment and implemented my own automation setup for 2nd building.

In the second building, I controlled 7 common lights from my own setup until now. 

Recently, I came across another automation unit that requires less tech and can do a similar job. I decided to give it a try. 

It’s working perfectly fine.

As this new system doesn’t require much tech, I decided to share this guide here, which is perfect for house construction users.

You must set up some setup during house construction time to make your job easier.

Whatever the setup I did for my own automation device in my second building is helping me to make any tech changes easily. 

This is one of the best things I implemented in both buildings. Now we no longer Turn ON or OFF our outdoor lights.

If this is something you want to implement in the right way, you can find more details below:
