I have a good and bad opinion about installing solar water heaters in the home for various reasons.

My personal preference is to go with solar panels. However, due to its low popularity, users are going with solar water heaters.

I didn't install a solar water heater in our second building because of some lessons that I learned in our first building.

Today, I'm sharing one more incident that happened a few days back in my home.

While playing football on our terrace, a student accidentally damaged one solar tube.

This is not the first time our solar tube has been damaged.

This is the 3rd tube which got damaged.

Once, while doing tube servicing time

Second, due to heavy wind, the plywood we kept next to the solar panel fell on the tube and got damaged.

And third now.

We were using Supreme Solar. Whatever the model we are using is not available in the market now.

We need to wait a few days. We need to pay whatever the cost demanded by the seller because it's a rare stock that is difficult to get.

If we don't get the same model solar tube, then we won't be able to use the solar water heater itself.

Somehow, every time damage happened, I still got a tube from the official service guy within a few days. But they are demanding a little more each time I order.

Solar tubes are very delicate items. It easily gets damaged. Even service engineers damage while they trying to clean.

It happened to us.

If you plan to install a solar water heater, keep this availability of solar tube point of view as well.

If you still choose a solar water heater for your house, you must know a few things during construction.

I shared all those things inside my building contractor guide with photos. Read those tips before or during construction time to avoid alternative options.

No. Most contractors don't guide you such things.

Oh.. did you imagine what could have happned if we didn't have CCTV on terrace?
