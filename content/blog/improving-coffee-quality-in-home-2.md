												Oh... today I&#39;m trying to share little off topic. The reason is, today I had one of the best coffees at home after a long time.

												Actually, I had stopped drinking coffee at home because the coffee quality wasn&#39;t good.

												We were thinking it was because of the coffee powder.

												Tried changing a lot of coffee powder brands&hellip; no result.

												Due to the coffee taste issue, I stopped taking coffee at home.

												From the past few days onwards, suddenly the coffee quality at home improved. Not just improved&mdash;it improved drastically&hellip;

												I asked my wife, &ldquo;How come the coffee quality suddenly improved these days?&rdquo;

												She replied, &ldquo;Now we no longer take/remove cream from the milk.&rdquo;

												Now the coffee quality at home went from bad to super.

												Earlier I used to hate drinking even half a glass of coffee. Now I happily drink almost 2 cups of coffee without hesitation&mdash;even multiple times a day.

												Give it a try at your home and see how it turns out.

												A good coffee, along with [written house construction guides](https://houseconstruction.pkarun.com/products/)&nbsp;can be a great combination.

												OK... my wife got angry because I didn&rsquo;t take her out to have masala puri. I&rsquo;m going to take her now.

												That&rsquo;s all for today.
