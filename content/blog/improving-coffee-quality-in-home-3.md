Oh... today I'm trying to share little off topic. The reason is, today I had one of the best coffees at home after a long time.

Actually, I had stopped drinking coffee at home because the coffee quality wasn't good.

We were thinking it was because of the coffee powder.

Tried changing a lot of coffee powder brands… no result.

Due to the coffee taste issue, I stopped taking coffee at home.

From the past few days onwards, suddenly the coffee quality at home improved. Not just improved—it improved drastically…

I asked my wife, “How come the coffee quality suddenly improved these days?”

She replied, “Now we no longer take/remove cream from the milk.”

Now the coffee quality at home went from bad to super.

Earlier I used to hate drinking even half a glass of coffee. Now I happily drink almost 2 cups of coffee without hesitation—even multiple times a day.

Give it a try at your home and see how it turns out.

A good coffee, along with [written house construction guides](https://houseconstruction.pkarun.com/products/) can be a great combination.

OK... my wife got angry because I didn’t take her out to have masala puri. I’m going to take her now.

That’s all for today.
